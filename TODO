- generate documentation for methods generated by JSONAttributes
- length restrictions for atts
- Paginated results and iterators
- Waiters (methods that wait for an object to be in a determined state)
- Retrying
- Handle StrToObj Maps in JSON, REST*, EC2 (if appliable) API Builders
- Exception handling
  - Manage 'return' value from
    - ec2-assign-private-ip-addresses.xml
    - ec2-associate-address.xml
    - ... lot's more in EC2 API ...
- JSON callers
  - when a boolean is returned from API, it doesn't get properly handed to 
    result objects (error thrown)
- enums in calling classes (for better parameter validation). Note: some shapes are used in
  responses too. It's known that APIs sometimes return more values than documented in the enums,
  so if enums are validated in results, this can result in unwanted exceptions 
- Objects that can ->Delete, or ->Update, calling service->Update(Id => ...)
- ResultParser and UnwrappedParser can maybe be fusioned. They're almost the same 
- for RDS and RedShift lists: adapt code so that botocore jsons don't have to be changed
- docu note for experimental / non-supported services
