=head1 NAME

Paws::Rekognition::IndexFaces - Arguments for method IndexFaces on Paws::Rekognition

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method IndexFaces on the 
Amazon Rekognition service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method IndexFaces.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to IndexFaces.

As an example:

  $service_obj->IndexFaces(Att1 => $value1, Att2 => $value2, ...);

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CollectionId => Str

The ID of an existing collection to which you want to add the faces
that are detected in the input images.



=head2 DetectionAttributes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

An array of facial attributes that you want to be returned. This can be
the default list of attributes or all attributes. If you don't specify
a value for C<Attributes> or if you specify C<["DEFAULT"]>, the API
returns the following subset of facial attributes: C<BoundingBox>,
C<Confidence>, C<Pose>, C<Quality> and C<Landmarks>. If you provide
C<["ALL"]>, all facial attributes are returned but the operation will
take longer to complete.

If you provide both, C<["ALL", "DEFAULT"]>, the service uses a logical
AND operator to determine which attributes to return (in this case, all
attributes).



=head2 ExternalImageId => Str

ID you want to assign to all the faces detected in the image.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Image => L<Paws::Rekognition::Image>

The input image as bytes or an S3 object.
