=head1 NAME

Paws::Glue::GetPartitions - Arguments for method GetPartitions on Paws::Glue

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method GetPartitions on the 
AWS Glue service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method GetPartitions.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to GetPartitions.

As an example:

  $service_obj->GetPartitions(Att1 => $value1, Att2 => $value2, ...);

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
