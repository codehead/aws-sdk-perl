=head1 NAME

Paws::WAF::ActivatedRule

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAF::ActivatedRule object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Action => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAF::ActivatedRule object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Action

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<ActivatedRule> object in an UpdateWebACL request specifies a
C<Rule> that you want to insert or delete, the priority of the C<Rule>
in the C<WebACL>, and the action that you want AWS WAF to take when a
web request matches the C<Rule> (C<ALLOW>, C<BLOCK>, or C<COUNT>).

To specify whether to insert or delete a C<Rule>, use the C<Action>
parameter in the WebACLUpdate data type.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Action => L<Paws::WAF::WafAction>

  Specifies the action that CloudFront or AWS WAF takes when a web
request matches the conditions in the C<Rule>. Valid values for
C<Action> include the following:

=over

=item *

C<ALLOW>: CloudFront responds with the requested object.

=item *

C<BLOCK>: CloudFront responds with an HTTP 403 (Forbidden) status code.

=item *

C<COUNT>: AWS WAF increments a counter of requests that match the
conditions in the rule and then continues to inspect the web request
based on the remaining rules in the web ACL.

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Priority => Int

  Specifies the order in which the C<Rules> in a C<WebACL> are evaluated.
Rules with a lower value for C<Priority> are evaluated before C<Rules>
with a higher value. The value must be a unique integer. If you add
multiple C<Rules> to a C<WebACL>, the values don't need to be
consecutive.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RuleId => Str

  The C<RuleId> for a C<Rule>. You use C<RuleId> to get more information
about a C<Rule> (see GetRule), update a C<Rule> (see UpdateRule),
insert a C<Rule> into a C<WebACL> or delete a one from a C<WebACL> (see
UpdateWebACL), or delete a C<Rule> from AWS WAF (see DeleteRule).

C<RuleId> is returned by CreateRule and by ListRules.


=head2 Type => Str

  The rule type, either C<REGULAR>, as defined by Rule, or C<RATE_BASED>,
as defined by RateBasedRule. The default is REGULAR. Although this
field is optional, be aware that if you try to add a RATE_BASED rule to
a web ACL without setting the type, the UpdateWebACL request will fail
because the request tries to add a REGULAR rule with the specified ID,
which does not exist.
