=head1 DESCRIPTION

Amazon Simple Email Service

This is the API Reference for Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES).
This documentation is intended to be used in conjunction with the I<
Amazon SES Developer Guide.>

For a list of Amazon SES endpoints to use in service requests, see
Regions and Amazon SES in the I< Amazon SES Developer Guide.>

=head1 METHODS

=head2 CloneReceiptRuleSet(OriginalRuleSetName => Str, RuleSetName => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::SES::CloneReceiptRuleSet>

Returns: a L<Paws::SES::CloneReceiptRuleSetResponse> instance

  Creates a receipt rule set by cloning an existing one. All receipt
rules and configurations are copied to the new receipt rule set and are
completely independent of the source rule set.

For information about setting up rule sets, see the I< Amazon SES
Developer Guide.>

You can execute this operation no more than once per second.


=head2 CreateConfigurationSet(ConfigurationSet => L<Paws::SES::ConfigurationSet>)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::SES::CreateConfigurationSet>

Returns: a L<Paws::SES::CreateConfigurationSetResponse> instance

  Creates a configuration set.

Configuration sets enable you to publish email sending events. For
information about using configuration sets, see the I< Amazon SES
Developer Guide.>

You can execute this operation no more than once per second.

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::SES::CreateConfigurationSetEventDestination>

Returns: a L<Paws::SES::CreateConfigurationSetEventDestinationResponse> instance

  Creates a configuration set event destination.

When you create or update an event destination, you must provide one,
and only one, destination. The destination can be Amazon CloudWatch,
Amazon Kinesis Firehose, or Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon
SNS).

An event destination is the AWS service to which Amazon SES publishes
the email sending events associated with a configuration set. For
information about using configuration sets, see the I< Amazon SES
Developer Guide.>

You can execute this operation no more than once per second.

  Creates an association between a configuration set and a custom domain
for open and click event tracking.

By default, images and links used for tracking open and click events
are hosted on domains operated by Amazon SES. You can configure a
subdomain of your own to handle these events by redirecting them to the
Amazon SES-operated domain. For information about using configuration
sets, see Configuring Custom Domains to Handle Open and Click Tracking
in the I< Amazon SES Developer Guide.>


=head2 CreateReceiptFilter(Filter => L<Paws::SES::ReceiptFilter>)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::SES::CreateReceiptFilter>

=head2 DeleteConfigurationSetEventDestination(ConfigurationSetName => Str, EventDestinationName => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::SES::DeleteConfigurationSetEventDestination>

Returns: a L<Paws::SES::DeleteConfigurationSetEventDestinationResponse> instance

  Deletes a configuration set event destination. Configuration set event
destinations are associated with configuration sets, which enable you
to publish email sending events. For information about using
configuration sets, see the I< Amazon SES Developer Guide.>

You can execute this operation no more than once per second.


=head2 DeleteConfigurationSetTrackingOptions(ConfigurationSetName => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::SES::DeleteConfigurationSetTrackingOptions>

Returns: a L<Paws::SES::DeleteConfigurationSetTrackingOptionsResponse> instance

  Deletes an association between a configuration set and a custom domain
for open and click event tracking.

By default, images and links used for tracking open and click events
are hosted on domains operated by Amazon SES. You can configure a
subdomain of your own to handle these events by redirecting them to the
Amazon SES-operated domain. For information about using configuration
sets, see Configuring Custom Domains to Handle Open and Click Tracking
in the I< Amazon SES Developer Guide.>

Deleting this kind of association will result in emails sent using the
specified configuration set to capture open and click events using the
standard, Amazon SES-operated domains.


=head2 DeleteIdentity(Identity => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::SES::DeleteIdentity>

Returns: a L<Paws::SES::DeleteIdentityResponse> instance

  Deletes the specified identity (an email address or a domain) from the
list of verified identities.

You can execute this operation no more than once per second.


=head2 DeleteIdentityPolicy(Identity => Str, PolicyName => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::SES::DeleteIdentityPolicy>

Returns: a L<Paws::SES::DeleteIdentityPolicyResponse> instance

  Deletes the specified sending authorization policy for the given
identity (an email address or a domain). This API returns successfully
even if a policy with the specified name does not exist.

This API is for the identity owner only. If you have not verified the
identity, this API will return an error.

Sending authorization is a feature that enables an identity owner to
authorize other senders to use its identities. For information about
using sending authorization, see the I< Amazon SES Developer Guide.>

You can execute this operation no more than once per second.


=head2 DeleteReceiptFilter(FilterName => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::SES::DeleteReceiptFilter>

Returns: a L<Paws::SES::DeleteReceiptFilterResponse> instance

  Deletes the specified IP address filter.

For information about managing IP address filters, see the I< Amazon
SES Developer Guide.>

=head2 DeleteReceiptRule(RuleName => Str, RuleSetName => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::SES::DeleteReceiptRule>

Returns: a L<Paws::SES::DeleteReceiptRuleResponse> instance

  Deletes the specified receipt rule.

For information about managing receipt rules, see the I< Amazon SES
Developer Guide.>

You can execute this operation no more than once per second.


=head2 DeleteReceiptRuleSet(RuleSetName => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::SES::DeleteReceiptRuleSet>

Returns: a L<Paws::SES::DeleteReceiptRuleSetResponse> instance

  Deletes the specified receipt rule set and all of the receipt rules it
contains.

The currently active rule set cannot be deleted.

For information about managing receipt rule sets, see the I< Amazon SES
Developer Guide.>

You can execute this operation no more than once per second.


=head2 DeleteVerifiedEmailAddress(EmailAddress => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::SES::DeleteVerifiedEmailAddress>

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::SES::GetIdentityDkimAttributes>

Returns: a L<Paws::SES::GetIdentityDkimAttributesResponse> instance

  Returns the current status of Easy DKIM signing for an entity. For
domain name identities, this operation also returns the DKIM tokens
that are required for Easy DKIM signing, and whether Amazon SES has
successfully verified that these tokens have been published.

This operation takes a list of identities as input and returns the
following information for each:

=over

=item *

Whether Easy DKIM signing is enabled or disabled.

=item *

A set of DKIM tokens that represent the identity. If the identity is an
email address, the tokens represent the domain of that address.

=item *

Whether Amazon SES has successfully verified the DKIM tokens published
in the domain's DNS. This information is only returned for domain name
identities, not for email addresses.

notification attributes for up to 100 identities at a time.

For more information about using notifications with Amazon SES, see the
I< Amazon SES Developer Guide.>


=head2 GetIdentityPolicies(Identity => Str, PolicyNames => ArrayRef[Str|Undef])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::SES::GetIdentityPolicies>

Returns: a L<Paws::SES::GetIdentityPoliciesResponse> instance

  Returns the requested sending authorization policies for the given
identity (an email address or a domain). The policies are returned as a
map of policy names to policy contents. You can retrieve a maximum of
20 policies at a time.

This API is for the identity owner only. If you have not verified the
identity, this API will return an error.

Sending authorization is a feature that enables an identity owner to
authorize other senders to use its identities. For information about
using sending authorization, see the I< Amazon SES Developer Guide.>

You can execute this operation no more than once per second.


=head2 GetIdentityVerificationAttributes(Identities => ArrayRef[Str|Undef])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::SES::GetIdentityVerificationAttributes>

Returns: a L<Paws::SES::GetIdentityVerificationAttributesResponse> instance

  Given a list of identities (email addresses and/or domains), returns
the verification status and (for domain identities) the verification
token for each identity.

The verification status of an email address is "Pending" until the
email address owner clicks the link within the verification email that
Amazon SES sent to that address. If the email address owner clicks the
link within 24 hours, the verification status of the email address
changes to "Success". If the link is not clicked within 24 hours, the
verification status changes to "Failed." In that case, if you still
want to verify the email address, you must restart the verification
process from the beginning.

For domain identities, the domain's verification status is "Pending" as
Amazon SES searches for the required TXT record in the DNS settings of
the domain. When Amazon SES detects the record, the domain's
verification status changes to "Success". If Amazon SES is unable to
detect the record within 72 hours, the domain's verification status
changes to "Failed." In that case, if you still want to verify the
domain, you must restart the verification process from the beginning.

This operation is throttled at one request per second and can only get
verification attributes for up to 100 identities at a time.


=head2 GetSendQuota( => )

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::SES::SendEmail>

Returns: a L<Paws::SES::SendEmailResponse> instance

  Composes an email message and immediately queues it for sending. In
order to send email using the C<SendEmail> operation, your message must
meet the following requirements:

=over

=item *

The message must be sent from a verified email address or domain. If
you attempt to send email using a non-verified address or domain, the
operation will result in an "Email address not verified" error.

=item *

If your account is still in the Amazon SES sandbox, you may only send
to verified addresses or domains, or to email addresses associated with
the Amazon SES Mailbox Simulator. For more information, see Verifying
Email Addresses and Domains in the I<Amazon SES Developer Guide>.

=item *

The total size of the message, including attachments, must be smaller
than 10 MB.

=item *

The message must include at least one recipient email address. The
recipient address can be a To: address, a CC: address, or a BCC:
address. If a recipient email address is invalid (that is, it is not in
the format I<UserName@[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain>), the entire
message will be rejected, even if the message contains other recipients
that are valid.

=item *

The message may not include more than 50 recipients, across the To:,
CC: and BCC: fields. If you need to send an email message to a larger
audience, you can divide your recipient list into groups of 50 or
fewer, and then call the C<SendEmail> operation several times to send
the message to each group.

=back

For every message that you send, the total number of recipients
(including each recipient in the To:, CC: and BCC: fields) is counted
against the maximum number of emails you can send in a 24-hour period
(your I<sending quota>). For more information about sending quotas in
Amazon SES, see Managing Your Amazon SES Sending Limits in the I<Amazon
SES Developer Guide>.


=head2 SendRawEmail(RawMessage => L<Paws::SES::RawMessage>, [ConfigurationSetName => Str, Destinations => ArrayRef[Str|Undef], FromArn => Str, ReturnPathArn => Str, Source => Str, SourceArn => Str, Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SES::MessageTag>]])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::SES::SendRawEmail>

Returns: a L<Paws::SES::SendRawEmailResponse> instance

  Composes an email message and immediately queues it for sending. When
calling this operation, you may specify the message headers as well as
the content. The C<SendRawEmail> operation is particularly useful for
sending multipart MIME emails (such as those that contain both a
plain-text and an HTML version).

In order to send email using the C<SendRawEmail> operation, your
message must meet the following requirements:

=over

=item *

The message must be sent from a verified email address or domain. If
you attempt to send email using a non-verified address or domain, the
operation will result in an "Email address not verified" error.

=item *

If your account is still in the Amazon SES sandbox, you may only send
to verified addresses or domains, or to email addresses associated with
the Amazon SES Mailbox Simulator. For more information, see Verifying
Email Addresses and Domains in the I<Amazon SES Developer Guide>.

=item *

The total size of the message, including attachments, must be smaller
than 10 MB.

=item *

The message must include at least one recipient email address. The
recipient address can be a To: address, a CC: address, or a BCC:
address. If a recipient email address is invalid (that is, it is not in
the format I<UserName@[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain>), the entire
message will be rejected, even if the message contains other recipients
that are valid.

=item *

The message may not include more than 50 recipients, across the To:,
CC: and BCC: fields. If you need to send an email message to a larger
audience, you can divide your recipient list into groups of 50 or
fewer, and then call the C<SendRawEmail> operation several times to
send the message to each group.

=back

For every message that you send, the total number of recipients
(including each recipient in the To:, CC: and BCC: fields) is counted
against the maximum number of emails you can send in a 24-hour period
(your I<sending quota>). For more information about sending quotas in
Amazon SES, see Managing Your Amazon SES Sending Limits in the I<Amazon
SES Developer Guide>.

Additionally, keep the following considerations in mind when using the
C<SendRawEmail> operation:

=over

=item *

Although you can customize the message headers when using the
C<SendRawEmail> operation, Amazon SES will automatically apply its own
C<Message-ID> and C<Date> headers; if you passed these headers when
creating the message, they will be overwritten by the values that
Amazon SES provides.

=item *

If you are using sending authorization to send on behalf of another
user, C<SendRawEmail> enables you to specify the cross-account identity
for the email's Source, From, and Return-Path parameters in one of two
ways: you can pass optional parameters C<SourceArn>, C<FromArn>, and/or
C<ReturnPathArn> to the API, or you can include the following X-headers
in the header of your raw email:

=over

=item *

C<X-SES-SOURCE-ARN>

=item *

C<X-SES-FROM-ARN>

=item *

C<X-SES-RETURN-PATH-ARN>

=back

Do not include these X-headers in the DKIM signature; Amazon SES will
remove them before sending the email.

For most common sending authorization scenarios, we recommend that you
specify the C<SourceIdentityArn> parameter and not the
C<FromIdentityArn> or C<ReturnPathIdentityArn> parameters. If you only
specify the C<SourceIdentityArn> parameter, Amazon SES will set the
From and Return Path addresses to the identity specified in
C<SourceIdentityArn>. For more information about sending authorization,
see the Using Sending Authorization with Amazon SES in the I<Amazon SES
Developer Guide>.

=back



=head2 SetActiveReceiptRuleSet([RuleSetName => Str])

You can execute this operation no more than once per second.


=head2 SetIdentityDkimEnabled(DkimEnabled => Bool, Identity => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::SES::SetIdentityDkimEnabled>

Returns: a L<Paws::SES::SetIdentityDkimEnabledResponse> instance

  Enables or disables Easy DKIM signing of email sent from an identity:

=over

=item *

If Easy DKIM signing is enabled for a domain name identity (such as
C<example.com>), then Amazon SES will DKIM-sign all email sent by
addresses under that domain name (for example, C<user@example.com>).

=item *

If Easy DKIM signing is enabled for an email address, then Amazon SES
will DKIM-sign all email sent by that email address.

=back

For email addresses (for example, C<user@example.com>), you can only
enable Easy DKIM signing if the corresponding domain (in this case,
C<example.com>) has been set up for Easy DKIM using the AWS Console or
the C<VerifyDomainDkim> operation.

You can execute this operation no more than once per second.
