This class represents the parameters used for calling the method UpdateMaintenanceWindow on the 
Amazon Simple Systems Manager (SSM) service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method UpdateMaintenanceWindow.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to UpdateMaintenanceWindow.
