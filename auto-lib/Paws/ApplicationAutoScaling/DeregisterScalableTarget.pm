=head1 NAME

Paws::ApplicationAutoScaling::DeregisterScalableTarget - Arguments for method DeregisterScalableTarget on Paws::ApplicationAutoScaling

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DeregisterScalableTarget on the 
Application Auto Scaling service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DeregisterScalableTarget.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DeregisterScalableTarget.

As an example:

  $service_obj->DeregisterScalableTarget(Att1 => $value1, Att2 => $value2, ...);

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ResourceId => Str

The identifier of the resource associated with the scalable target.
This string consists of the resource type and unique identifier.

=over

=item *

ECS service - The resource type is C<service> and the unique identifier
is the cluster name and service name. Example:
C<service/default/sample-webapp>.

=item *

Spot fleet request - The resource type is C<spot-fleet-request> and the
unique identifier is the Spot fleet request ID. Example:
C<spot-fleet-request/sfr-73fbd2ce-aa30-494c-8788-1cee4EXAMPLE>.

=item *

EMR cluster - The resource type is C<instancegroup> and the unique
identifier is the cluster ID and instance group ID. Example:
C<instancegroup/j-2EEZNYKUA1NTV/ig-1791Y4E1L8YI0>.

=item *

AppStream 2.0 fleet - The resource type is C<fleet> and the unique
identifier is the fleet name. Example: C<fleet/sample-fleet>.

=item *

DynamoDB table - The resource type is C<table> and the unique
identifier is the resource ID. Example: C<table/my-table>.

=item *

DynamoDB global secondary index - The resource type is C<index> and the
unique identifier is the resource ID. Example:
C<table/my-table/index/my-table-index>.

=head2 B<REQUIRED> ScalableDimension => Str

The scalable dimension associated with the scalable target. This string
consists of the service namespace, resource type, and scaling property.

=over

=item *

C<ecs:service:DesiredCount> - The desired task count of an ECS service.

=item *

C<ec2:spot-fleet-request:TargetCapacity> - The target capacity of a
Spot fleet request.

=item *

C<elasticmapreduce:instancegroup:InstanceCount> - The instance count of
an EMR Instance Group.

=item *

C<appstream:fleet:DesiredCapacity> - The desired capacity of an
AppStream 2.0 fleet.

=item *

C<dynamodb:table:ReadCapacityUnits> - The provisioned read capacity for
a DynamoDB table.

=item *

C<dynamodb:table:WriteCapacityUnits> - The provisioned write capacity
for a DynamoDB table.

=item *

C<dynamodb:index:ReadCapacityUnits> - The provisioned read capacity for
a DynamoDB global secondary index.

=item *

C<dynamodb:index:WriteCapacityUnits> - The provisioned write capacity
for a DynamoDB global secondary index.
