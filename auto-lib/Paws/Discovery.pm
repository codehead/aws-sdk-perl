  my $res = $obj->Method(
    Arg1 => $val1,
    Arg2 => [ 'V1', 'V2' ],
    # if Arg3 is an object, the HashRef will be used as arguments to the constructor
    # of the arguments type
    Arg3 => { Att1 => 'Val1' },
    # if Arg4 is an array of objects, the HashRefs will be passed as arguments to
    # the constructor of the arguments type
    Arg4 => [ { Att1 => 'Val1'  }, { Att1 => 'Val2' } ],
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

AWS Application Discovery Service

AWS Application Discovery Service helps you plan application migration
projects by automatically identifying servers, virtual machines (VMs),
software, and software dependencies running in your on-premises data
centers. Application Discovery Service also collects application
performance data, which can help you assess the outcome of your
migration. The data collected by Application Discovery Service is
securely retained in an Amazon-hosted and managed database in the
cloud. You can export the data as a CSV or XML file into your preferred
visualization tool or cloud-migration solution to plan your migration.
For more information, see the Application Discovery Service FAQ.

Application Discovery Service offers two modes of operation.

=over

=item *

B<Agentless discovery> mode is recommended for environments that use
VMware vCenter Server. This mode doesn't require you to install an
agent on each host. Agentless discovery gathers server information
regardless of the operating systems, which minimizes the time required
for initial on-premises infrastructure assessment. Agentless discovery
doesn't collect information about software and software dependencies.
It also doesn't work in non-VMware environments. We recommend that you
use agent-based discovery for non-VMware environments and if you want
to collect information about software and software dependencies. You
can also run agent-based and agentless discovery simultaneously. Use
agentless discovery to quickly complete the initial infrastructure
assessment and then install agents on select hosts to gather
information about software and software dependencies.

=item *

B<Agent-based discovery> mode collects a richer set of data than
agentless discovery by using Amazon software, the AWS Application
Discovery Agent, which you install on one or more hosts in your data
center. The agent captures infrastructure and application information,
including an inventory of installed software applications, system and
process performance, resource utilization, and network dependencies
between workloads. The information collected by agents is secured at
rest and in transit to the Application Discovery Service database in
the cloud.

=back

Application Discovery Service integrates with application discovery
solutions from AWS Partner Network (APN) partners. Third-party
application discovery tools can query Application Discovery Service and
write to the Application Discovery Service database using a public API.
You can then import the data into either a visualization tool or
cloud-migration solution.

Application Discovery Service doesn't gather sensitive information. All
data is handled according to the AWS Privacy Policy. You can operate
Application Discovery Service using offline mode to inspect collected
data before it is shared with the service.

Your AWS account must be granted access to Application Discovery
Service, a process called I<whitelisting>. This is true for AWS
partners and customers alike. To request access, sign up for AWS
Application Discovery Service here. We send you information about how
to get started.

This API reference provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples
for each of the actions and data types for Application Discovery
Service. The topic for each action shows the API request parameters and
the response. Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to access
an API that is tailored to the programming language or platform that
you're using. For more information, see AWS SDKs.

This guide is intended for use with the I<AWS Application Discovery
Service User Guide> .
