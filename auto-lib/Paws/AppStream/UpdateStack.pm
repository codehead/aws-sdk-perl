Paws::AppStream::UpdateStack - Arguments for method UpdateStack on Paws::AppStream

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method UpdateStack on the 
Amazon AppStream service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method UpdateStack.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to UpdateStack.
