Paws::GameLift::DescribeMatchmakingConfigurations - Arguments for method DescribeMatchmakingConfigurations on Paws::GameLift

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DescribeMatchmakingConfigurations on the 
Amazon GameLift service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DescribeMatchmakingConfigurations.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DescribeMatchmakingConfigurations.

As an example:
