=head1 NAME

Paws::CognitoIdp::ChangePassword - Arguments for method ChangePassword on Paws::CognitoIdp

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ChangePassword on the 
Amazon Cognito Identity Provider service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ChangePassword.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ChangePassword.

As an example:
