=head1 NAME

Paws::Route53::ListVPCAssociationAuthorizations - Arguments for method ListVPCAssociationAuthorizations on Paws::Route53

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ListVPCAssociationAuthorizations on the 
Amazon Route 53 service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ListVPCAssociationAuthorizations.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ListVPCAssociationAuthorizations.

As an example:

  $service_obj->ListVPCAssociationAuthorizations(Att1 => $value1, Att2 => $value2, ...);

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> HostedZoneId => Str

The ID of the hosted zone for which you want a list of VPCs that can be
associated with the hosted zone.



=head2 MaxResults => Str

I<Optional>: An integer that specifies the maximum number of VPCs that
you want Amazon Route 53 to return. If you don't specify a value for
C<MaxResults>, Amazon Route 53 returns up to 50 VPCs per page.



=head2 NextToken => Str

I<Optional>: If a response includes a C<NextToken> element, there are
more VPCs that can be associated with the specified hosted zone. To get
the next page of results, submit another request, and include the value
of C<NextToken> from the response in the C<nexttoken> parameter in
another C<ListVPCAssociationAuthorizations> request.
