=head1 NAME

Paws::Route53::AliasTarget

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Route53::AliasTarget object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DNSName => $value, ..., HostedZoneId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Route53::AliasTarget object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DNSName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

I<Alias resource record sets only:> Information about the CloudFront
distribution, Elastic Beanstalk environment, ELB load balancer, Amazon
S3 bucket, or Amazon Route 53 resource record set that you're
redirecting queries to. An Elastic Beanstalk environment must have a
regionalized subdomain.

When creating resource record sets for a private hosted zone, note the
following:

=over

=item *

Resource record sets can't be created for CloudFront distributions in a
private hosted zone.

=item *

Creating geolocation alias resource record sets or latency alias
resource record sets in a private hosted zone is unsupported.

=item *

For information about creating failover resource record sets in a
private hosted zone, see Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DNSName => Str

  I<Alias resource record sets only:> The value that you specify depends
on where you want to route queries:

=over

=item CloudFront distribution

Specify the domain name that CloudFront assigned when you created your
distribution.

Your CloudFront distribution must include an alternate domain name that
matches the name of the resource record set. For example, if the name
of the resource record set is I<acme.example.com>, your CloudFront
distribution must include I<acme.example.com> as one of the alternate
domain names. For more information, see Using Alternate Domain Names
(CNAMEs) in the I<Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide>.

=item Elastic Beanstalk environment

Specify the C<CNAME> attribute for the environment. (The environment
must have a regionalized domain name.) You can use the following
methods to get the value of the CNAME attribute:

=over

=item *

I<AWS Management Console>: For information about how to get the value
by using the console, see Using Custom Domains with AWS Elastic
Beanstalk in the I<AWS Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide>.

=item *

I<Elastic Beanstalk API>: Use the C<DescribeEnvironments> action to get
the value of the C<CNAME> attribute. For more information, see
DescribeEnvironments in the I<AWS Elastic Beanstalk API Reference>.

=item *

I<AWS CLI>: Use the C<describe-environments> command to get the value
of the C<CNAME> attribute. For more information, see
describe-environments in the I<AWS Command Line Interface Reference>.

=back

=item ELB load balancer

Specify the DNS name that is associated with the load balancer. Get the
DNS name by using the AWS Management Console, the ELB API, or the AWS
CLI.

=over

=item *

B<AWS Management Console>: Go to the EC2 page, choose B<Load Balancers>
in the navigation pane, choose the load balancer, choose the
B<Description> tab, and get the value of the B<DNS name> field. (If
you're routing traffic to a Classic Load Balancer, get the value that
begins with B<dualstack>.)

=item *

B<Elastic Load Balancing API>: Use C<DescribeLoadBalancers> to get the
value of C<DNSName>. For more information, see the applicable guide:

=over

=item *

Classic Load Balancers: DescribeLoadBalancers

=item *

Application and Network Load Balancers: DescribeLoadBalancers

=back

=item *

B<AWS CLI>: Use C<describe-load-balancers> to get the value of
C<DNSName>. For more information, see the applicable guide:

=over

=item *

Classic Load Balancers: describe-load-balancers

=item *

Application and Network Load Balancers: describe-load-balancers

=back

=back

=item Amazon S3 bucket that is configured as a static website

Specify the domain name of the Amazon S3 website endpoint in which you
created the bucket, for example, C<s3-website-us-east-2.amazonaws.com>.
For more information about valid values, see the table Amazon Simple
Storage Service (S3) Website Endpoints in the I<Amazon Web Services
General Reference>. For more information about using S3 buckets for
websites, see Getting Started with Amazon Route 53 in the I<Amazon
Route 53 Developer Guide.>

=item Another Amazon Route 53 resource record set

Specify the value of the C<Name> element for a resource record set in
the current hosted zone.

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> EvaluateTargetHealth => Bool

  I<Applies only to alias, failover alias, geolocation alias, latency
alias, and weighted alias resource record sets:> When
C<EvaluateTargetHealth> is C<true>, an alias resource record set
inherits the health of the referenced AWS resource, such as an ELB load
balancer, or the referenced resource record set.

Note the following:

=over

=item *

You can't set C<EvaluateTargetHealth> to C<true> when the alias target
is a CloudFront distribution.

=item *

If the AWS resource that you specify in C<AliasTarget> is a resource
record set or a group of resource record sets (for example, a group of
weighted resource record sets), but it is not another alias resource
record set, we recommend that you associate a health check with all of
the resource record sets in the alias target. For more information, see
What Happens When You Omit Health Checks? in the I<Amazon Route 53
Developer Guide>.

=item *

If you specify an Elastic Beanstalk environment in C<HostedZoneId> and
C<DNSName>, and if the environment contains an ELB load balancer,
Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2
instances that are registered with the load balancer. (An environment
automatically contains an ELB load balancer if it includes more than
one EC2 instance.) If you set C<EvaluateTargetHealth> to C<true> and
either no EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is
unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 routes queries to other available resources
that are healthy, if any.

If the environment contains a single EC2 instance, there are no special
requirements.

=item *

If you specify an ELB load balancer in C< AliasTarget >, ELB routes
queries only to the healthy EC2 instances that are registered with the
load balancer. If no EC2 instances are healthy or if the load balancer
itself is unhealthy, and if C<EvaluateTargetHealth> is true for the
corresponding alias resource record set, Amazon Route 53 routes queries
to other resources. When you create a load balancer, you configure
settings for ELB health checks; they're not Amazon Route 53 health
checks, but they perform a similar function. Do not create Amazon Route
53 health checks for the EC2 instances that you register with an ELB
load balancer.

For more information, see How Health Checks Work in More Complex Amazon
Route 53 Configurations in the I<Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide>.

=item *

We recommend that you set C<EvaluateTargetHealth> to true only when you
have enough idle capacity to handle the failure of one or more
endpoints.

=back

For more information and examples, see Amazon Route 53 Health Checks
and DNS Failover in the I<Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> HostedZoneId => Str

  I<Alias resource records sets only>: The value used depends on where
you want to route traffic:

=over

=item CloudFront distribution

Specify C<Z2FDTNDATAQYW2>.

Alias resource record sets for CloudFront can't be created in a private
zone.

=item Elastic Beanstalk environment

Specify the hosted zone ID for the region in which you created the
environment. The environment must have a regionalized subdomain. For a
list of regions and the corresponding hosted zone IDs, see AWS Elastic
Beanstalk in the "AWS Regions and Endpoints" chapter of the I<Amazon
Web Services General Reference>.

=item ELB load balancer

Specify the value of the hosted zone ID for the load balancer. Use the
following methods to get the hosted zone ID:

=over

=item *

Elastic Load Balancing table in the "AWS Regions and Endpoints" chapter
of the I<Amazon Web Services General Reference>: Use the value that
corresponds with the region that you created your load balancer in.
Note that there are separate columns for Application and Classic Load
Balancers and for Network Load Balancers.

=item *

B<AWS Management Console>: Go to the Amazon EC2 page, choose B<Load
Balancers> in the navigation pane, select the load balancer, and get
the value of the B<Hosted zone> field on the B<Description> tab.

=item *

B<Elastic Load Balancing API>: Use C<DescribeLoadBalancers> to get the
value of C<CanonicalHostedZoneNameId>. For more information, see the
applicable guide:

=item *

B<AWS CLI>: Use C<describe-load-balancers> to get the value of
C<CanonicalHostedZoneNameID> (for Classic Load Balancers) or
C<CanonicalHostedZoneNameID> (for Application and Network Load
Balancers). For more information, see the applicable guide:
