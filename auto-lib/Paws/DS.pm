=head1 NAME

Paws::DS - Perl Interface to AWS AWS Directory Service

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Paws;

  my $obj = Paws->service('DS');
  my $res = $obj->Method(
    Arg1 => $val1,
    Arg2 => [ 'V1', 'V2' ],
    # if Arg3 is an object, the HashRef will be used as arguments to the constructor

  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

AWS Directory Service

AWS Directory Service is a web service that makes it easy for you to
setup and run directories in the AWS cloud, or connect your AWS
resources with an existing on-premises Microsoft Active Directory. This
guide provides detailed information about AWS Directory Service
operations, data types, parameters, and errors. For information about
AWS Directory Services features, see AWS Directory Service and the AWS
Directory Service Administration Guide.

AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various
programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, Android,
etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access
to AWS Directory Service and other AWS services. For more information
about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see
Tools for Amazon Web Services.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 AddIpRoutes(DirectoryId => Str, IpRoutes => ArrayRef[L<Paws::DS::IpRoute>], [UpdateSecurityGroupForDirectoryControllers => Bool])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::DS::AddIpRoutes>

Returns: a L<Paws::DS::AddIpRoutesResult> instance

  If the DNS server for your on-premises domain uses a publicly
addressable IP address, you must add a CIDR address block to correctly
route traffic to and from your Microsoft AD on Amazon Web Services.
I<AddIpRoutes> adds this address block. You can also use I<AddIpRoutes>
to facilitate routing traffic that uses public IP ranges from your
Microsoft AD on AWS to a peer VPC.

Before you call I<AddIpRoutes>, ensure that all of the required
permissions have been explicitly granted through a policy. For details
about what permissions are required to run the I<AddIpRoutes>
operation, see AWS Directory Service API Permissions: Actions,
Resources, and Conditions Reference.


=head2 AddTagsToResource(ResourceId => Str, Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::DS::Tag>])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::DS::AddTagsToResource>

Returns: a L<Paws::DS::AddTagsToResourceResult> instance

  Adds or overwrites one or more tags for the specified directory. Each
directory can have a maximum of 50 tags. Each tag consists of a key and
optional value. Tag keys must be unique to each resource.


=head2 CancelSchemaExtension(DirectoryId => Str, SchemaExtensionId => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::DS::CancelSchemaExtension>

Returns: a L<Paws::DS::CancelSchemaExtensionResult> instance

  Cancels an in-progress schema extension to a Microsoft AD directory.
Once a schema extension has started replicating to all domain
controllers, the task can no longer be canceled. A schema extension can
be canceled during any of the following states; C<Initializing>,
C<CreatingSnapshot>, and C<UpdatingSchema>.


=head2 ConnectDirectory(ConnectSettings => L<Paws::DS::DirectoryConnectSettings>, Name => Str, Password => Str, Size => Str, [Description => Str, ShortName => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::DS::ConnectDirectory>

Returns: a L<Paws::DS::ConnectDirectoryResult> instance

  Creates an AD Connector to connect to an on-premises directory.

Before you call I<ConnectDirectory>, ensure that all of the required
permissions have been explicitly granted through a policy. For details
about what permissions are required to run the I<ConnectDirectory>
operation, see AWS Directory Service API Permissions: Actions,
Resources, and Conditions Reference.


=head2 CreateAlias(Alias => Str, DirectoryId => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::DS::CreateAlias>

Returns: a L<Paws::DS::CreateAliasResult> instance

  Creates an alias for a directory and assigns the alias to the
directory. The alias is used to construct the access URL for the
directory, such as C<http://E<lt>aliasE<gt>.awsapps.com>.

After an alias has been created, it cannot be deleted or reused, so
this operation should only be used when absolutely necessary.


=head2 CreateComputer(ComputerName => Str, DirectoryId => Str, Password => Str, [ComputerAttributes => ArrayRef[L<Paws::DS::Attribute>], OrganizationalUnitDistinguishedName => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::DS::CreateComputer>

Returns: a L<Paws::DS::CreateComputerResult> instance

  Creates a computer account in the specified directory, and joins the
computer to the directory.


=head2 CreateConditionalForwarder(DirectoryId => Str, DnsIpAddrs => ArrayRef[Str|Undef], RemoteDomainName => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::DS::CreateConditionalForwarder>

Returns: a L<Paws::DS::CreateConditionalForwarderResult> instance

  Creates a conditional forwarder associated with your AWS directory.
Conditional forwarders are required in order to set up a trust
relationship with another domain. The conditional forwarder points to
the trusted domain.


=head2 CreateDirectory(Name => Str, Password => Str, Size => Str, [Description => Str, ShortName => Str, VpcSettings => L<Paws::DS::DirectoryVpcSettings>])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::DS::CreateDirectory>

Returns: a L<Paws::DS::CreateDirectoryResult> instance

  Creates a Simple AD directory.

Before you call I<CreateDirectory>, ensure that all of the required
permissions have been explicitly granted through a policy. For details
about what permissions are required to run the I<CreateDirectory>
operation, see AWS Directory Service API Permissions: Actions,
Resources, and Conditions Reference.


=head2 CreateMicrosoftAD(Name => Str, Password => Str, VpcSettings => L<Paws::DS::DirectoryVpcSettings>, [Description => Str, ShortName => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::DS::CreateMicrosoftAD>

Returns: a L<Paws::DS::CreateMicrosoftADResult> instance

  Creates a Microsoft AD in the AWS cloud.

Before you call I<CreateMicrosoftAD>, ensure that all of the required
permissions have been explicitly granted through a policy. For details
about what permissions are required to run the I<CreateMicrosoftAD>
operation, see AWS Directory Service API Permissions: Actions,
Resources, and Conditions Reference.


=head2 CreateSnapshot(DirectoryId => Str, [Name => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::DS::CreateSnapshot>

Returns: a L<Paws::DS::CreateSnapshotResult> instance

  Creates a snapshot of a Simple AD or Microsoft AD directory in the AWS
cloud.

You cannot take snapshots of AD Connector directories.


=head2 CreateTrust(DirectoryId => Str, RemoteDomainName => Str, TrustDirection => Str, TrustPassword => Str, [ConditionalForwarderIpAddrs => ArrayRef[Str|Undef], TrustType => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::DS::CreateTrust>

Returns: a L<Paws::DS::CreateTrustResult> instance

  AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory allows you to
configure trust relationships. For example, you can establish a trust
between your Microsoft AD in the AWS cloud, and your existing
on-premises Microsoft Active Directory. This would allow you to provide
users and groups access to resources in either domain, with a single
set of credentials.

This action initiates the creation of the AWS side of a trust
relationship between a Microsoft AD in the AWS cloud and an external
domain.


=head2 DeleteConditionalForwarder(DirectoryId => Str, RemoteDomainName => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::DS::DeleteConditionalForwarder>

operation, see AWS Directory Service API Permissions: Actions,
Resources, and Conditions Reference.

changes. You get notified if your directory goes from an Active status
to an Impaired or Inoperable status. You also receive a notification
when the directory returns to an Active status.
