=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudDirectory::BatchRead - Arguments for method BatchRead on Paws::CloudDirectory

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method BatchRead on the 
Amazon CloudDirectory service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method BatchRead.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to BatchRead.

As an example:

  $service_obj->BatchRead(Att1 => $value1, Att2 => $value2, ...);

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

update of an object is reflected in a subsequent read operation of that
same object.

Valid values are: C<"SERIALIZABLE">, C<"EVENTUAL">

=head2 B<REQUIRED> DirectoryArn => Str
