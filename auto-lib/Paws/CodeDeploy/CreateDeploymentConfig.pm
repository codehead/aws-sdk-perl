=head1 NAME

Paws::CodeDeploy::CreateDeploymentConfig - Arguments for method CreateDeploymentConfig on Paws::CodeDeploy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateDeploymentConfig on the 
AWS CodeDeploy service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateDeploymentConfig.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateDeploymentConfig.

As an example:

  $service_obj->CreateDeploymentConfig(Att1 => $value1, Att2 => $value2, ...);

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DeploymentConfigName => Str

The name of the deployment configuration to create.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> MinimumHealthyHosts => L<Paws::CodeDeploy::MinimumHealthyHosts>

The minimum number of healthy instances that should be available at any
time during the deployment. There are two parameters expected in the
input: type and value.

The type parameter takes either of the following values:

=over

=item *

HOST_COUNT: The value parameter represents the minimum number of
healthy instances as an absolute value.

=item *

FLEET_PERCENT: The value parameter represents the minimum number of
healthy instances as a percentage of the total number of instances in
the deployment. If you specify FLEET_PERCENT, at the start of the
deployment, AWS CodeDeploy converts the percentage to the equivalent
number of instance and rounds up fractional instances.

=back

The value parameter takes an integer.

For example, to set a minimum of 95% healthy instance, specify a type
of FLEET_PERCENT and a value of 95.
