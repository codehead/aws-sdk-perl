This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateDevicePool on the 
AWS Device Farm service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateDevicePool.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateDevicePool.
