=head1 NAME

Paws::ELBv2::ModifyListener - Arguments for method ModifyListener on Paws::ELBv2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ModifyListener on the 
Elastic Load Balancing service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ModifyListener.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ModifyListener.

As an example:

  $service_obj->ModifyListener(Att1 => $value1, Att2 => $value2, ...);

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Certificates => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ELBv2::Certificate>]

The SSL server certificate.



=head2 DefaultActions => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ELBv2::Action>]

The default action. For Application Load Balancers, the protocol of the
specified target group must be HTTP or HTTPS. For Network Load
Balancers, the protocol of the specified target group must be TCP.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> ListenerArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the listener.



=head2 Port => Int

The port for connections from clients to the load balancer.



=head2 Protocol => Str

The protocol for connections from clients to the load balancer.
Application Load Balancers support HTTP and HTTPS and Network Load
Balancers support TCP.

Valid values are: C<"HTTP">, C<"HTTPS">, C<"TCP">

=head2 SslPolicy => Str

The security policy that defines which protocols and ciphers are
supported. For more information, see Security Policies in the
I<Application Load Balancers Guide>.
