=head1 NAME

Paws::ELBv2::SetSubnets - Arguments for method SetSubnets on Paws::ELBv2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method SetSubnets on the 
Elastic Load Balancing service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method SetSubnets.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to SetSubnets.

As an example:

  $service_obj->SetSubnets(Att1 => $value1, Att2 => $value2, ...);

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> LoadBalancerArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the load balancer.



=head2 SubnetMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ELBv2::SubnetMapping>]

The IDs of the subnets. You must specify subnets from at least two
Availability Zones. You can specify only one subnet per Availability
Zone. You must specify either subnets or subnet mappings.

The load balancer is allocated one static IP address per subnet. You
cannot specify your own Elastic IP addresses.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Subnets => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The IDs of the subnets. You must specify subnets from at least two
Availability Zones. You can specify only one subnet per Availability
Zone. You must specify either subnets or subnet mappings.
