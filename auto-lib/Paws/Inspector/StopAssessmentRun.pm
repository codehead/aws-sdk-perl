=head1 NAME

Paws::Inspector::StopAssessmentRun - Arguments for method StopAssessmentRun on Paws::Inspector

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method StopAssessmentRun on the 
Amazon Inspector service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method StopAssessmentRun.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to StopAssessmentRun.

As an example:

  $service_obj->StopAssessmentRun(Att1 => $value1, Att2 => $value2, ...);

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AssessmentRunArn => Str

The ARN of the assessment run that you want to stop.



=head2 StopAction => Str

An input option that can be set to either START_EVALUATION or
SKIP_EVALUATION. START_EVALUATION (the default value), stops the AWS
agent from collecting data and begins the results evaluation and the
findings generation process. SKIP_EVALUATION cancels the assessment run
immediately, after which no findings are generated.

Valid values are: C<"START_EVALUATION">, C<"SKIP_EVALUATION">
