Paws::CodePipeline::PutThirdPartyJobSuccessResult - Arguments for method PutThirdPartyJobSuccessResult on Paws::CodePipeline

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method PutThirdPartyJobSuccessResult on the 
AWS CodePipeline service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method PutThirdPartyJobSuccessResult.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to PutThirdPartyJobSuccessResult.

As an example:

  $service_obj->PutThirdPartyJobSuccessResult(Att1 => $value1, Att2 => $value2, ...);

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ClientToken => Str

The clientToken portion of the clientId and clientToken pair used to
verify that the calling entity is allowed access to the job and its
details.



=head2 ContinuationToken => Str

A token generated by a job worker, such as an AWS CodeDeploy deployment
ID, that a successful job provides to identify a partner action in
progress. Future jobs will use this token in order to identify the
running instance of the action. It can be reused to return additional
information about the progress of the partner action. When the action
is complete, no continuation token should be supplied.



=head2 CurrentRevision => L<Paws::CodePipeline::CurrentRevision>

Represents information about a current revision.



=head2 ExecutionDetails => L<Paws::CodePipeline::ExecutionDetails>

The details of the actions taken and results produced on an artifact as
it passes through stages in the pipeline.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> JobId => Str

The ID of the job that successfully completed. This is the same ID
returned from PollForThirdPartyJobs.
