Paws::WorkDocs::CreateUser - Arguments for method CreateUser on Paws::WorkDocs

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateUser on the 
Amazon WorkDocs service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateUser.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateUser.
