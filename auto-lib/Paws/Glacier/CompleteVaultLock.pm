=head1 NAME

Paws::Glacier::CompleteVaultLock - Arguments for method CompleteVaultLock on Paws::Glacier

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CompleteVaultLock on the 
Amazon Glacier service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CompleteVaultLock.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CompleteVaultLock.

As an example:

  $service_obj->CompleteVaultLock(Att1 => $value1, Att2 => $value2, ...);

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AccountId => Str

The C<AccountId> value is the AWS account ID. This value must match the
AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the
request. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a
single 'C<->' (hyphen), in which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS
account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If
you specify your account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the
ID.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> LockId => Str

The C<lockId> value is the lock ID obtained from a InitiateVaultLock
request.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> VaultName => Str

The name of the vault.
