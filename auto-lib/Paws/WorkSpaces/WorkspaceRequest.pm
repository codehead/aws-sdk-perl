=head1 NAME

Paws::WorkSpaces::WorkspaceRequest

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WorkSpaces::WorkspaceRequest object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BundleId => $value, ..., WorkspaceProperties => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WorkSpaces::WorkspaceRequest object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BundleId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information about a WorkSpace creation request.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> BundleId => Str

  The identifier of the bundle to create the WorkSpace from. You can use
the DescribeWorkspaceBundles operation to obtain a list of the bundles

WorkSpace in. You can use the DescribeWorkspaceDirectories operation to
obtain a list of the directories that are available.


=head2 RootVolumeEncryptionEnabled => Bool

  Specifies whether the data stored on the root volume, or C: drive, is
encrypted.


=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::WorkSpaces::Tag>]

  The tags of the WorkSpace request.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> UserName => Str

exist in the AWS Directory Service directory specified by the
C<DirectoryId> member.


=head2 UserVolumeEncryptionEnabled => Bool

  Specifies whether the data stored on the user volume, or D: drive, is
encrypted.


=head2 VolumeEncryptionKey => Str
