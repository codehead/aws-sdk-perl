=head1 NAME

Paws::Lambda::UpdateFunctionConfiguration - Arguments for method UpdateFunctionConfiguration on Paws::Lambda

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method UpdateFunctionConfiguration on the 
AWS Lambda service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method UpdateFunctionConfiguration.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to UpdateFunctionConfiguration.

As an example:

  $service_obj->UpdateFunctionConfiguration(Att1 => $value1, Att2 => $value2, ...);

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DeadLetterConfig => L<Paws::Lambda::DeadLetterConfig>

The parent object that contains the target ARN (Amazon Resource Name)
of an Amazon SQS queue or Amazon SNS topic.



=head2 Description => Str

A short user-defined function description. AWS Lambda does not use this
value. Assign a meaningful description as you see fit.



=head2 Environment => L<Paws::Lambda::Environment>

The parent object that contains your environment's configuration
settings.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> FunctionName => Str

The name of the Lambda function.

You can specify a function name (for example, C<Thumbnail>) or you can
specify Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the function (for example,
C<arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:account-id:function:ThumbNail>). AWS Lambda
also allows you to specify a partial ARN (for example,
C<account-id:Thumbnail>). Note that the length constraint applies only
to the ARN. If you specify only the function name, it is limited to 64
character in length.



=head2 Handler => Str

The function that Lambda calls to begin executing your function. For
Node.js, it is the C<module-name.export> value in your function.



=head2 KMSKeyArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key used to encrypt your
function's environment variables. If you elect to use the AWS Lambda
default service key, pass in an empty string ("") for this parameter.



=head2 MemorySize => Int

The amount of memory, in MB, your Lambda function is given. AWS Lambda
uses this memory size to infer the amount of CPU allocated to your
function. Your function use-case determines your CPU and memory
requirements. For example, a database operation might need less memory
compared to an image processing function. The default value is 128 MB.
The value must be a multiple of 64 MB.



=head2 Role => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that Lambda will assume
when it executes your function.



=head2 Runtime => Str

The runtime environment for the Lambda function.

To use the Python runtime v3.6, set the value to "python3.6". To use
the Python runtime v2.7, set the value to "python2.7". To use the
Node.js runtime v6.10, set the value to "nodejs6.10". To use the
Node.js runtime v4.3, set the value to "nodejs4.3". To use the Python
runtime v3.6, set the value to "python3.6".

Node v0.10.42 is currently marked as deprecated. You must migrate
existing functions to the newer Node.js runtime versions available on
AWS Lambda (nodejs4.3 or nodejs6.10) as soon as possible. You can
request a one-time extension until June 30, 2017 by going to the Lambda
console and following the instructions provided. Failure to do so will
result in an invalid parameter error being returned. Note that you will
have to follow this procedure for each region that contains functions
written in the Node v0.10.42 runtime.

Valid values are: C<"nodejs">, C<"nodejs4.3">, C<"nodejs6.10">, C<"java8">, C<"python2.7">, C<"python3.6">, C<"dotnetcore1.0">, C<"nodejs4.3-edge">

=head2 Timeout => Int

The function execution time at which AWS Lambda should terminate the
function. Because the execution time has cost implications, we
recommend you set this value based on your expected execution time. The
default is 3 seconds.



=head2 TracingConfig => L<Paws::Lambda::TracingConfig>

The parent object that contains your function's tracing settings.



=head2 VpcConfig => L<Paws::Lambda::VpcConfig>
