=head1 NAME

Paws::Lambda::UntagResource - Arguments for method UntagResource on Paws::Lambda

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method UntagResource on the 
AWS Lambda service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method UntagResource.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to UntagResource.

As an example:

  $service_obj->UntagResource(Att1 => $value1, Att2 => $value2, ...);

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head2 B<REQUIRED> Resource => Str

The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the function.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> TagKeys => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The list of tag keys to be deleted from the function.
