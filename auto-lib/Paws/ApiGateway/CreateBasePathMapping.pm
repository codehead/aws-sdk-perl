=head1 NAME

Paws::ApiGateway::CreateBasePathMapping - Arguments for method CreateBasePathMapping on Paws::ApiGateway

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateBasePathMapping on the 
Amazon API Gateway service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateBasePathMapping.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateBasePathMapping.

As an example:

  $service_obj->CreateBasePathMapping(Att1 => $value1, Att2 => $value2, ...);

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BasePath => Str

The base path name that callers of the API must provide as part of the
URL after the domain name. This value must be unique for all of the
mappings across a single API. Leave this blank if you do not want
callers to specify a base path name after the domain name.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> DomainName => Str

The domain name of the BasePathMapping resource to create.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> RestApiId => Str

The string identifier of the associated RestApi.



=head2 Stage => Str

The name of the API's stage that you want to use for this mapping.
Leave this blank if you do not want callers to explicitly specify the
stage name after any base path name.
