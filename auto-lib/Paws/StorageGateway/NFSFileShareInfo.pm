=head1 NAME

Paws::StorageGateway::NFSFileShareInfo

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::StorageGateway::NFSFileShareInfo object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ClientList => $value, ..., Squash => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::StorageGateway::NFSFileShareInfo object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ClientList

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Unix file permissions and ownership information assigned, by
default, to native S3 objects when file gateway discovers them in S3
buckets. This operation is only supported in file gateways.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ClientList => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

  


=head2 DefaultStorageClass => Str

  The default storage class for objects put into an Amazon S3 bucket by
file gateway. Possible values are S3_STANDARD or S3_STANDARD_IA. If
this field is not populated, the default value S3_STANDARD is used.
Optional.


=head2 FileShareARN => Str

  


=head2 FileShareId => Str

  


=head2 FileShareStatus => Str

  


=head2 GatewayARN => Str

  


=head2 KMSEncrypted => Bool

  True to use Amazon S3 server side encryption with your own KMS key, or
false to use a key managed by Amazon S3. Optional.
