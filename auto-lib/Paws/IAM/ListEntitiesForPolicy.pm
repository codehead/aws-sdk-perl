=head1 NAME

Paws::IAM::ListEntitiesForPolicy - Arguments for method ListEntitiesForPolicy on Paws::IAM

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ListEntitiesForPolicy on the 
AWS Identity and Access Management service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ListEntitiesForPolicy.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ListEntitiesForPolicy.

As an example:

  $service_obj->ListEntitiesForPolicy(Att1 => $value1, Att2 => $value2, ...);

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 EntityFilter => Str

The entity type to use for filtering the results.

For example, when C<EntityFilter> is C<Role>, only the roles that are
attached to the specified policy are returned. This parameter is
optional. If it is not included, all attached entities (users, groups,
and roles) are returned. The argument for this parameter must be one of
the valid values listed below.

Valid values are: C<"User">, C<"Role">, C<"Group">, C<"LocalManagedPolicy">, C<"AWSManagedPolicy">

=head2 Marker => Str

Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you
receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to
the value of the C<Marker> element in the response that you received to
indicate where the next call should start.



=head2 MaxItems => Int

(Optional) Use this only when paginating results to indicate the
maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items
exist beyond the maximum you specify, the C<IsTruncated> response
element is C<true>.

If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to 100. Note that IAM
might return fewer results, even when there are more results available.
In that case, the C<IsTruncated> response element returns C<true> and
C<Marker> contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells
the service where to continue from.



=head2 PathPrefix => Str

The path prefix for filtering the results. This parameter is optional.
If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/), listing all
entities.

This paramater allows (per its regex pattern) a string of characters
consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that
must begin and end with forward slashes, containing any ASCII character
from the ! (\u0021) thru the DEL character (\u007F), including most
punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> PolicyArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM policy for which you want the
versions.

For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and
AWS Service Namespaces in the I<AWS General Reference>.
