Paws::IAM - Perl Interface to AWS AWS Identity and Access Management

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Paws;

  my $obj = Paws->service('IAM');
  my $res = $obj->Method(
    Arg1 => $val1,
    Arg2 => [ 'V1', 'V2' ],
    # if Arg3 is an object, the HashRef will be used as arguments to the constructor
    # of the arguments type
    Arg3 => { Att1 => 'Val1' },
    # if Arg4 is an array of objects, the HashRefs will be passed as arguments to
    # the constructor of the arguments type
    Arg4 => [ { Att1 => 'Val1'  }, { Att1 => 'Val2' } ],
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

AWS Identity and Access Management

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that you can
use to manage users and user permissions under your AWS account. This
guide provides descriptions of IAM actions that you can call
programmatically. For general information about IAM, see AWS Identity
and Access Management (IAM). For the user guide for IAM, see Using IAM.

AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various
programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android,
etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access
to IAM and AWS. For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as
cryptographically signing requests (see below), managing errors, and
retrying requests automatically. For information about the AWS SDKs,
including how to download and install them, see the Tools for Amazon
Web Services page.

We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls
to IAM. However, you can also use the IAM Query API to make direct
calls to the IAM web service. To learn more about the IAM Query API,
see Making Query Requests in the I<Using IAM> guide. IAM supports GET
and POST requests for all actions. That is, the API does not require
you to use GET for some actions and POST for others. However, GET
requests are subject to the limitation size of a URL. Therefore, for
operations that require larger sizes, use a POST request.

B<Signing Requests>

Requests must be signed using an access key ID and a secret access key.
We strongly recommend that you do not use your AWS account access key
ID and secret access key for everyday work with IAM. You can use the
access key ID and secret access key for an IAM user or you can use the
AWS Security Token Service to generate temporary security credentials
and use those to sign requests.

To sign requests, we recommend that you use Signature Version 4. If you
have an existing application that uses Signature Version 2, you do not
have to update it to use Signature Version 4. However, some operations
now require Signature Version 4. The documentation for operations that
require version 4 indicate this requirement.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 AddClientIDToOpenIDConnectProvider(ClientID => Str, OpenIDConnectProviderArn => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::AddClientIDToOpenIDConnectProvider>

Returns: nothing

  Adds a new client ID (also known as audience) to the list of client IDs
already registered for the specified IAM OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider
resource.

This action is idempotent; it does not fail or return an error if you
add an existing client ID to the provider.


=head2 AddRoleToInstanceProfile(InstanceProfileName => Str, RoleName => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::AddRoleToInstanceProfile>

Returns: nothing

  Adds the specified IAM role to the specified instance profile. An
instance profile can contain only one role, and this limit cannot be
increased.

The caller of this API must be granted the C<PassRole> permission on
the IAM role by a permission policy.

For more information about roles, go to Working with Roles. For more
information about instance profiles, go to About Instance Profiles.


=head2 AddUserToGroup(GroupName => Str, UserName => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::AddUserToGroup>

Returns: nothing

  Adds the specified user to the specified group.


=head2 AttachGroupPolicy(GroupName => Str, PolicyArn => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::AttachGroupPolicy>

Returns: nothing

  Attaches the specified managed policy to the specified IAM group.

You use this API to attach a managed policy to a group. To embed an
inline policy in a group, use PutGroupPolicy.

For more information about policies, see Managed Policies and Inline
Policies in the I<IAM User Guide>.


=head2 AttachRolePolicy(PolicyArn => Str, RoleName => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::AttachRolePolicy>

Returns: nothing

  Attaches the specified managed policy to the specified IAM role. When
you attach a managed policy to a role, the managed policy becomes part
of the role's permission (access) policy.

You cannot use a managed policy as the role's trust policy. The role's
trust policy is created at the same time as the role, using CreateRole.
You can update a role's trust policy using UpdateAssumeRolePolicy.

Use this API to attach a I<managed> policy to a role. To embed an
inline policy in a role, use PutRolePolicy. For more information about
policies, see Managed Policies and Inline Policies in the I<IAM User
Guide>.


=head2 AttachUserPolicy(PolicyArn => Str, UserName => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::AttachUserPolicy>

Returns: nothing

  Attaches the specified managed policy to the specified user.

You use this API to attach a I<managed> policy to a user. To embed an
inline policy in a user, use PutUserPolicy.

For more information about policies, see Managed Policies and Inline
Policies in the I<IAM User Guide>.


=head2 ChangePassword(NewPassword => Str, OldPassword => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::ChangePassword>

Returns: nothing

  Changes the password of the IAM user who is calling this action. The
root account password is not affected by this action.

To change the password for a different user, see UpdateLoginProfile.
For more information about modifying passwords, see Managing Passwords
in the I<IAM User Guide>.


=head2 CreateAccessKey([UserName => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::CreateAccessKey>

Returns: a L<Paws::IAM::CreateAccessKeyResponse> instance

  Creates a new AWS secret access key and corresponding AWS access key ID
for the specified user. The default status for new keys is C<Active>.

If you do not specify a user name, IAM determines the user name
implicitly based on the AWS access key ID signing the request. Because
this action works for access keys under the AWS account, you can use
this action to manage root credentials even if the AWS account has no
associated users.

For information about limits on the number of keys you can create, see
Limitations on IAM Entities in the I<IAM User Guide>.

To ensure the security of your AWS account, the secret access key is
accessible only during key and user creation. You must save the key
(for example, in a text file) if you want to be able to access it
again. If a secret key is lost, you can delete the access keys for the
associated user and then create new keys.


=head2 CreateAccountAlias(AccountAlias => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::CreateAccountAlias>

Returns: nothing

  Creates an alias for your AWS account. For information about using an
AWS account alias, see Using an Alias for Your AWS Account ID in the
I<IAM User Guide>.


=head2 CreateGroup(GroupName => Str, [Path => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::CreateGroup>

Returns: a L<Paws::IAM::CreateGroupResponse> instance

  Creates a new group.

For information about the number of groups you can create, see
Limitations on IAM Entities in the I<IAM User Guide>.


=head2 CreateInstanceProfile(InstanceProfileName => Str, [Path => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::CreateInstanceProfile>

Returns: a L<Paws::IAM::CreateInstanceProfileResponse> instance

  Creates a new instance profile. For information about instance
profiles, go to About Instance Profiles.

For information about the number of instance profiles you can create,
see Limitations on IAM Entities in the I<IAM User Guide>.


=head2 CreateLoginProfile(Password => Str, UserName => Str, [PasswordResetRequired => Bool])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::CreateLoginProfile>

Returns: a L<Paws::IAM::CreateLoginProfileResponse> instance

  Creates a password for the specified user, giving the user the ability
to access AWS services through the AWS Management Console. For more
information about managing passwords, see Managing Passwords in the
I<IAM User Guide>.


=head2 CreateOpenIDConnectProvider(ThumbprintList => ArrayRef[Str|Undef], Url => Str, [ClientIDList => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::CreateOpenIDConnectProvider>

Returns: a L<Paws::IAM::CreateOpenIDConnectProviderResponse> instance

  Creates an IAM entity to describe an identity provider (IdP) that
supports OpenID Connect (OIDC).

The OIDC provider that you create with this operation can be used as a
principal in a role's trust policy to establish a trust relationship
between AWS and the OIDC provider.

When you create the IAM OIDC provider, you specify the URL of the OIDC
identity provider (IdP) to trust, a list of client IDs (also known as
audiences) that identify the application or applications that are
allowed to authenticate using the OIDC provider, and a list of
thumbprints of the server certificate(s) that the IdP uses. You get all
of this information from the OIDC IdP that you want to use for access
to AWS.

Because trust for the OIDC provider is ultimately derived from the IAM
provider that this action creates, it is a best practice to limit
access to the CreateOpenIDConnectProvider action to highly-privileged
users.


=head2 CreatePolicy(PolicyDocument => Str, PolicyName => Str, [Description => Str, Path => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::CreatePolicy>

Returns: a L<Paws::IAM::CreatePolicyResponse> instance

  Creates a new managed policy for your AWS account.

This operation creates a policy version with a version identifier of
C<v1> and sets v1 as the policy's default version. For more information
about policy versions, see Versioning for Managed Policies in the I<IAM
User Guide>.

For more information about managed policies in general, see Managed
Policies and Inline Policies in the I<IAM User Guide>.


=head2 CreatePolicyVersion(PolicyArn => Str, PolicyDocument => Str, [SetAsDefault => Bool])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::CreatePolicyVersion>

Returns: a L<Paws::IAM::CreatePolicyVersionResponse> instance

  Creates a new version of the specified managed policy. To update a
managed policy, you create a new policy version. A managed policy can
have up to five versions. If the policy has five versions, you must
delete an existing version using DeletePolicyVersion before you create
a new version.

Optionally, you can set the new version as the policy's default
version. The default version is the version that is in effect for the
IAM users, groups, and roles to which the policy is attached.

For more information about managed policy versions, see Versioning for
Managed Policies in the I<IAM User Guide>.


=head2 CreateRole(AssumeRolePolicyDocument => Str, RoleName => Str, [Description => Str, Path => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::CreateRole>

Returns: a L<Paws::IAM::CreateRoleResponse> instance

  Creates a new role for your AWS account. For more information about
roles, go to Working with Roles. For information about limitations on
role names and the number of roles you can create, go to Limitations on
IAM Entities in the I<IAM User Guide>.


=head2 CreateSAMLProvider(Name => Str, SAMLMetadataDocument => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::CreateSAMLProvider>

Returns: a L<Paws::IAM::CreateSAMLProviderResponse> instance

  Creates an IAM resource that describes an identity provider (IdP) that
supports SAML 2.0.

The SAML provider resource that you create with this operation can be
used as a principal in an IAM role's trust policy to enable federated
users who sign-in using the SAML IdP to assume the role. You can create
an IAM role that supports Web-based single sign-on (SSO) to the AWS
Management Console or one that supports API access to AWS.

When you create the SAML provider resource, you upload an a SAML
metadata document that you get from your IdP and that includes the
issuer's name, expiration information, and keys that can be used to
validate the SAML authentication response (assertions) that the IdP
sends. You must generate the metadata document using the identity
management software that is used as your organization's IdP.

This operation requires Signature Version 4.

For more information, see Enabling SAML 2.0 Federated Users to Access
the AWS Management Console and About SAML 2.0-based Federation in the
I<IAM User Guide>.


=head2 CreateServiceLinkedRole(AWSServiceName => Str, [CustomSuffix => Str, Description => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::CreateServiceLinkedRole>

Returns: a L<Paws::IAM::CreateServiceLinkedRoleResponse> instance

  Creates an IAM role that is linked to a specific AWS service. The
service controls the attached policies and when the role can be
deleted. This helps ensure that the service is not broken by an
unexpectedly changed or deleted role, which could put your AWS
resources into an unknown state. Allowing the service to control the
role helps improve service stability and proper cleanup when a service
and its role are no longer needed.

The name of the role is autogenerated by combining the string that you
specify for the C<AWSServiceName> parameter with the string that you
specify for the C<CustomSuffix> parameter. The resulting name must be
unique in your account or the request fails.

To attach a policy to this service-linked role, you must make the
request using the AWS service that depends on this role.


=head2 CreateServiceSpecificCredential(ServiceName => Str, UserName => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::CreateServiceSpecificCredential>

Returns: a L<Paws::IAM::CreateServiceSpecificCredentialResponse> instance

  Generates a set of credentials consisting of a user name and password
that can be used to access the service specified in the request. These
credentials are generated by IAM, and can be used only for the
specified service.

You can have a maximum of two sets of service-specific credentials for
each supported service per user.

The only supported service at this time is AWS CodeCommit.

You can reset the password to a new service-generated value by calling
ResetServiceSpecificCredential.

For more information about service-specific credentials, see Using IAM
with AWS CodeCommit: Git Credentials, SSH Keys, and AWS Access Keys in
the I<IAM User Guide>.


=head2 CreateUser(UserName => Str, [Path => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::CreateUser>

Returns: a L<Paws::IAM::CreateUserResponse> instance

  Creates a new IAM user for your AWS account.

For information about limitations on the number of IAM users you can
create, see Limitations on IAM Entities in the I<IAM User Guide>.


=head2 CreateVirtualMFADevice(VirtualMFADeviceName => Str, [Path => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::CreateVirtualMFADevice>

Returns: a L<Paws::IAM::CreateVirtualMFADeviceResponse> instance

  Creates a new virtual MFA device for the AWS account. After creating
the virtual MFA, use EnableMFADevice to attach the MFA device to an IAM
user. For more information about creating and working with virtual MFA
devices, go to Using a Virtual MFA Device in the I<IAM User Guide>.

For information about limits on the number of MFA devices you can
create, see Limitations on Entities in the I<IAM User Guide>.

The seed information contained in the QR code and the Base32 string
should be treated like any other secret access information, such as
your AWS access keys or your passwords. After you provision your
virtual device, you should ensure that the information is destroyed
following secure procedures.


=head2 DeactivateMFADevice(SerialNumber => Str, UserName => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::DeactivateMFADevice>

Returns: nothing

  Deactivates the specified MFA device and removes it from association
with the user name for which it was originally enabled.

For more information about creating and working with virtual MFA
devices, go to Using a Virtual MFA Device in the I<IAM User Guide>.


=head2 DeleteAccessKey(AccessKeyId => Str, [UserName => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::DeleteAccessKey>

Returns: nothing

  Deletes the access key pair associated with the specified IAM user.

If you do not specify a user name, IAM determines the user name
implicitly based on the AWS access key ID signing the request. Because
this action works for access keys under the AWS account, you can use
this action to manage root credentials even if the AWS account has no
associated users.


=head2 DeleteAccountAlias(AccountAlias => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::DeleteAccountAlias>

Returns: nothing

  Deletes the specified AWS account alias. For information about using an
AWS account alias, see Using an Alias for Your AWS Account ID in the
I<IAM User Guide>.


=head2 DeleteAccountPasswordPolicy( => )

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::DeleteAccountPasswordPolicy>

Returns: nothing

  Deletes the password policy for the AWS account. There are no
parameters.


=head2 DeleteGroup(GroupName => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::DeleteGroup>

Returns: nothing

  Deletes the specified IAM group. The group must not contain any users
or have any attached policies.


=head2 DeleteGroupPolicy(GroupName => Str, PolicyName => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::DeleteGroupPolicy>

Returns: nothing

  Deletes the specified inline policy that is embedded in the specified
IAM group.

A group can also have managed policies attached to it. To detach a
managed policy from a group, use DetachGroupPolicy. For more
information about policies, refer to Managed Policies and Inline
Policies in the I<IAM User Guide>.


=head2 DeleteInstanceProfile(InstanceProfileName => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::DeleteInstanceProfile>

Returns: nothing

  Deletes the specified instance profile. The instance profile must not
have an associated role.

Make sure you do not have any Amazon EC2 instances running with the
instance profile you are about to delete. Deleting a role or instance
profile that is associated with a running instance will break any
applications running on the instance.

For more information about instance profiles, go to About Instance
Profiles.


=head2 DeleteLoginProfile(UserName => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::DeleteLoginProfile>

Returns: nothing

  Deletes the password for the specified IAM user, which terminates the
user's ability to access AWS services through the AWS Management
Console.

Deleting a user's password does not prevent a user from accessing AWS
through the command line interface or the API. To prevent all user
access you must also either make any access keys inactive or delete
them. For more information about making keys inactive or deleting them,
see UpdateAccessKey and DeleteAccessKey.


=head2 DeleteOpenIDConnectProvider(OpenIDConnectProviderArn => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::DeleteOpenIDConnectProvider>

Returns: nothing

  Deletes an OpenID Connect identity provider (IdP) resource object in
IAM.

Deleting an IAM OIDC provider resource does not update any roles that
reference the provider as a principal in their trust policies. Any
attempt to assume a role that references a deleted provider fails.

This action is idempotent; it does not fail or return an error if you
call the action for a provider that does not exist.


=head2 DeletePolicy(PolicyArn => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::DeletePolicy>

Returns: nothing

  Deletes the specified managed policy.

Before you can delete a managed policy, you must first detach the
policy from all users, groups, and roles that it is attached to, and
you must delete all of the policy's versions. The following steps
describe the process for deleting a managed policy:

=over

=item *

Detach the policy from all users, groups, and roles that the policy is
attached to, using the DetachUserPolicy, DetachGroupPolicy, or
DetachRolePolicy APIs. To list all the users, groups, and roles that a
policy is attached to, use ListEntitiesForPolicy.

=item *

Policies in the I<IAM User Guide>.


=head2 DeletePolicyVersion(PolicyArn => Str, VersionId => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::DeletePolicyVersion>

Returns: nothing

  Deletes the specified version from the specified managed policy.

You cannot delete the default version from a policy using this API. To
delete the default version from a policy, use DeletePolicy. To find out
which version of a policy is marked as the default version, use
ListPolicyVersions.

For information about versions for managed policies, see Versioning for
Managed Policies in the I<IAM User Guide>.


=head2 DeleteRole(RoleName => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::DeleteRole>

Returns: nothing

  Deletes the specified role. The role must not have any policies
attached. For more information about roles, go to Working with Roles.

Make sure you do not have any Amazon EC2 instances running with the
role you are about to delete. Deleting a role or instance profile that
is associated with a running instance will break any applications
running on the instance.


=head2 DeleteRolePolicy(PolicyName => Str, RoleName => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::DeleteRolePolicy>

Returns: nothing

  Deletes the specified inline policy that is embedded in the specified
IAM role.

A role can also have managed policies attached to it. To detach a
managed policy from a role, use DetachRolePolicy. For more information
about policies, refer to Managed Policies and Inline Policies in the
I<IAM User Guide>.


=head2 DeleteSAMLProvider(SAMLProviderArn => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::DeleteSAMLProvider>

Returns: nothing

  Deletes a SAML provider resource in IAM.

Deleting the provider resource from IAM does not update any roles that
reference the SAML provider resource's ARN as a principal in their
trust policies. Any attempt to assume a role that references a
non-existent provider resource ARN fails.

This operation requires Signature Version 4.


=head2 DeleteServerCertificate(ServerCertificateName => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::DeleteServerCertificate>

Returns: nothing

  Deletes the specified server certificate.

For more information about working with server certificates, including
a list of AWS services that can use the server certificates that you
manage with IAM, go to Working with Server Certificates in the I<IAM
User Guide>.

If you are using a server certificate with Elastic Load Balancing,
deleting the certificate could have implications for your application.
If Elastic Load Balancing doesn't detect the deletion of bound
certificates, it may continue to use the certificates. This could cause
Elastic Load Balancing to stop accepting traffic. We recommend that you
remove the reference to the certificate from Elastic Load Balancing
before using this command to delete the certificate. For more
information, go to DeleteLoadBalancerListeners in the I<Elastic Load
Balancing API Reference>.


=head2 DeleteServiceLinkedRole(RoleName => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::DeleteServiceLinkedRole>

Returns: a L<Paws::IAM::DeleteServiceLinkedRoleResponse> instance

  Submits a service-linked role deletion request and returns a
C<DeletionTaskId>, which you can use to check the status of the
deletion. Before you call this operation, confirm that the role has no
active sessions and that any resources used by the role in the linked
service are deleted. If you call this operation more than once for the
same service-linked role and an earlier deletion task is not complete,
then the C<DeletionTaskId> of the earlier request is returned.

If you submit a deletion request for a service-linked role whose linked
service is still accessing a resource, then the deletion task fails. If
it fails, the GetServiceLinkedRoleDeletionStatus API operation returns
the reason for the failure, including the resources that must be
deleted. To delete the service-linked role, you must first remove those
resources from the linked service and then submit the deletion request
again. Resources are specific to the service that is linked to the
role. For more information about removing resources from a service, see
the AWS documentation for your service.

For more information about service-linked roles, see Roles Terms and
Concepts: AWS Service-Linked Role in the I<IAM User Guide>.

Returns: a L<Paws::IAM::ListServiceSpecificCredentialsResponse> instance

  Returns information about the service-specific credentials associated
with the specified IAM user. If there are none, the action returns an
empty list. The service-specific credentials returned by this action
are used only for authenticating the IAM user to a specific service.
For more information about using service-specific credentials to
authenticate to an AWS service, see Set Up service-specific credentials
in the AWS CodeCommit User Guide.


=head2 ListSigningCertificates([Marker => Str, MaxItems => Int, UserName => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::ListSigningCertificates>

Returns: a L<Paws::IAM::ListSigningCertificatesResponse> instance

  Returns information about the signing certificates associated with the
specified IAM user. If there are none, the action returns an empty
list.

Although each user is limited to a small number of signing
certificates, you can still paginate the results using the C<MaxItems>
and C<Marker> parameters.

If the C<UserName> field is not specified, the user name is determined
implicitly based on the AWS access key ID used to sign the request for
this API. Because this action works for access keys under the AWS
account, you can use this action to manage root credentials even if the
AWS account has no associated users.

parameters.


=head2 PutGroupPolicy(GroupName => Str, PolicyDocument => Str, PolicyName => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::PutGroupPolicy>

Returns: nothing

  Adds or updates an inline policy document that is embedded in the
specified IAM group.

A user can also have managed policies attached to it. To attach a
managed policy to a group, use AttachGroupPolicy. To create a new
managed policy, use CreatePolicy. For information about policies, see
Managed Policies and Inline Policies in the I<IAM User Guide>.

For information about limits on the number of inline policies that you
can embed in a group, see Limitations on IAM Entities in the I<IAM User
Guide>.

Because policy documents can be large, you should use POST rather than
GET when calling C<PutGroupPolicy>. For general information about using
the Query API with IAM, go to Making Query Requests in the I<IAM User
Guide>.


=head2 PutRolePolicy(PolicyDocument => Str, PolicyName => Str, RoleName => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::PutRolePolicy>

Returns: nothing

  Adds or updates an inline policy document that is embedded in the
specified IAM role.

When you embed an inline policy in a role, the inline policy is used as
part of the role's access (permissions) policy. The role's trust policy
is created at the same time as the role, using CreateRole. You can
update a role's trust policy using UpdateAssumeRolePolicy. For more
information about IAM roles, go to Using Roles to Delegate Permissions
and Federate Identities.

A role can also have a managed policy attached to it. To attach a
managed policy to a role, use AttachRolePolicy. To create a new managed
policy, use CreatePolicy. For information about policies, see Managed
Policies and Inline Policies in the I<IAM User Guide>.

For information about limits on the number of inline policies that you
can embed with a role, see Limitations on IAM Entities in the I<IAM
User Guide>.

try to remove a client ID that does not exist.


=head2 RemoveRoleFromInstanceProfile(InstanceProfileName => Str, RoleName => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::RemoveRoleFromInstanceProfile>

Returns: nothing

  Removes the specified IAM role from the specified EC2 instance profile.

Make sure you do not have any Amazon EC2 instances running with the
role you are about to remove from the instance profile. Removing a role
from an instance profile that is associated with a running instance
might break any applications running on the instance.

For more information about IAM roles, go to Working with Roles. For
more information about instance profiles, go to About Instance
Profiles.


=head2 RemoveUserFromGroup(GroupName => Str, UserName => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::RemoveUserFromGroup>

Returns: nothing

  Removes the specified user from the specified group.


=head2 ResetServiceSpecificCredential(ServiceSpecificCredentialId => Str, [UserName => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::ResetServiceSpecificCredential>

Returns: a L<Paws::IAM::ResetServiceSpecificCredentialResponse> instance

  Resets the password for a service-specific credential. The new password
is AWS generated and cryptographically strong. It cannot be configured
by the user. Resetting the password immediately invalidates the
previous password associated with this user.


=head2 ResyncMFADevice(AuthenticationCode1 => Str, AuthenticationCode2 => Str, SerialNumber => Str, UserName => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::ResyncMFADevice>

Returns: nothing

  Synchronizes the specified MFA device with its IAM resource object on
the AWS servers.

For more information about creating and working with virtual MFA
devices, go to Using a Virtual MFA Device in the I<IAM User Guide>.


=head2 SetDefaultPolicyVersion(PolicyArn => Str, VersionId => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::SetDefaultPolicyVersion>

Returns: nothing

  Sets the specified version of the specified policy as the policy's
default (operative) version.

This action affects all users, groups, and roles that the policy is
attached to. To list the users, groups, and roles that the policy is
attached to, use the ListEntitiesForPolicy API.

For information about managed policies, see Managed Policies and Inline
Policies in the I<IAM User Guide>.


=head2 SimulateCustomPolicy(ActionNames => ArrayRef[Str|Undef], PolicyInputList => ArrayRef[Str|Undef], [CallerArn => Str, ContextEntries => ArrayRef[L<Paws::IAM::ContextEntry>], Marker => Str, MaxItems => Int, ResourceArns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef], ResourceHandlingOption => Str, ResourceOwner => Str, ResourcePolicy => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::SimulateCustomPolicy>

Returns: a L<Paws::IAM::SimulatePolicyResponse> instance

  Simulate how a set of IAM policies and optionally a resource-based
policy works with a list of API actions and AWS resources to determine
the policies' effective permissions. The policies are provided as
strings.

The simulation does not perform the API actions; it only checks the
authorization to determine if the simulated policies allow or deny the
actions.

If you want to simulate existing policies attached to an IAM user,
group, or role, use SimulatePrincipalPolicy instead.

Context keys are variables maintained by AWS and its services that
provide details about the context of an API query request. You can use
the C<Condition> element of an IAM policy to evaluate context keys. To
get the list of context keys that the policies require for correct
simulation, use GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy.

If the output is long, you can use C<MaxItems> and C<Marker> parameters
to paginate the results.


=head2 SimulatePrincipalPolicy(ActionNames => ArrayRef[Str|Undef], PolicySourceArn => Str, [CallerArn => Str, ContextEntries => ArrayRef[L<Paws::IAM::ContextEntry>], Marker => Str, MaxItems => Int, PolicyInputList => ArrayRef[Str|Undef], ResourceArns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef], ResourceHandlingOption => Str, ResourceOwner => Str, ResourcePolicy => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::SimulatePrincipalPolicy>

Returns: a L<Paws::IAM::SimulatePolicyResponse> instance

  Simulate how a set of IAM policies attached to an IAM entity works with
a list of API actions and AWS resources to determine the policies'
effective permissions. The entity can be an IAM user, group, or role.
If you specify a user, then the simulation also includes all of the
policies that are attached to groups that the user belongs to .

You can optionally include a list of one or more additional policies
specified as strings to include in the simulation. If you want to
simulate only policies specified as strings, use SimulateCustomPolicy
instead.

You can also optionally include one resource-based policy to be
evaluated with each of the resources included in the simulation.

The simulation does not perform the API actions, it only checks the
authorization to determine if the simulated policies allow or deny the
actions.

B<Note:> This API discloses information about the permissions granted
to other users. If you do not want users to see other user's
permissions, then consider allowing them to use SimulateCustomPolicy
instead.

Context keys are variables maintained by AWS and its services that
provide details about the context of an API query request. You can use
the C<Condition> element of an IAM policy to evaluate context keys. To
get the list of context keys that the policies require for correct
simulation, use GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy.

If the output is long, you can use the C<MaxItems> and C<Marker>
parameters to paginate the results.


=head2 UpdateAccessKey(AccessKeyId => Str, Status => Str, [UserName => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::UpdateAccessKey>

Returns: nothing

  Changes the status of the specified access key from Active to Inactive,
or vice versa. This action can be used to disable a user's key as part
of a key rotation work flow.

If the C<UserName> field is not specified, the UserName is determined
implicitly based on the AWS access key ID used to sign the request.
Because this action works for access keys under the AWS account, you
can use this action to manage root credentials even if the AWS account
has no associated users.

For information about rotating keys, see Managing Keys and Certificates
in the I<IAM User Guide>.


=head2 UpdateAccountPasswordPolicy([AllowUsersToChangePassword => Bool, HardExpiry => Bool, MaxPasswordAge => Int, MinimumPasswordLength => Int, PasswordReusePrevention => Int, RequireLowercaseCharacters => Bool, RequireNumbers => Bool, RequireSymbols => Bool, RequireUppercaseCharacters => Bool])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::UpdateAccountPasswordPolicy>

Returns: nothing

  Updates the password policy settings for the AWS account.

This action does not support partial updates. No parameters are
required, but if you do not specify a parameter, that parameter's value
reverts to its default value. See the B<Request Parameters> section for
each parameter's default value.

For more information about using a password policy, see Managing an IAM
Password Policy in the I<IAM User Guide>.


=head2 UpdateAssumeRolePolicy(PolicyDocument => Str, RoleName => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::UpdateAssumeRolePolicy>

Returns: nothing

  Updates the policy that grants an IAM entity permission to assume a
role. This is typically referred to as the "role trust policy". For
more information about roles, go to Using Roles to Delegate Permissions
and Federate Identities.


=head2 UpdateGroup(GroupName => Str, [NewGroupName => Str, NewPath => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::UpdateGroup>

Returns: nothing

  Updates the name and/or the path of the specified IAM group.

You should understand the implications of changing a group's path or
name. For more information, see Renaming Users and Groups in the I<IAM
User Guide>.

To change an IAM group name the requester must have appropriate
permissions on both the source object and the target object. For
example, to change "Managers" to "MGRs", the entity making the request
must have permission on both "Managers" and "MGRs", or must have
permission on all (*). For more information about permissions, see
Permissions and Policies.


=head2 UpdateLoginProfile(UserName => Str, [Password => Str, PasswordResetRequired => Bool])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::UpdateLoginProfile>

Returns: nothing

  Changes the password for the specified IAM user.

IAM users can change their own passwords by calling ChangePassword. For
more information about modifying passwords, see Managing Passwords in
the I<IAM User Guide>.


=head2 UpdateOpenIDConnectProviderThumbprint(OpenIDConnectProviderArn => Str, ThumbprintList => ArrayRef[Str|Undef])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::UpdateOpenIDConnectProviderThumbprint>

Returns: nothing

  Replaces the existing list of server certificate thumbprints associated
with an OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider resource object with a new list
of thumbprints.

The list that you pass with this action completely replaces the
existing list of thumbprints. (The lists are not merged.)

Typically, you need to update a thumbprint only when the identity
provider's certificate changes, which occurs rarely. However, if the
provider's certificate I<does> change, any attempt to assume an IAM
role that specifies the OIDC provider as a principal fails until the
certificate thumbprint is updated.

Because trust for the OIDC provider is ultimately derived from the
provider's certificate and is validated by the thumbprint, it is a best
practice to limit access to the
C<UpdateOpenIDConnectProviderThumbprint> action to highly-privileged
users.


=head2 UpdateRoleDescription(Description => Str, RoleName => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::UpdateRoleDescription>

Returns: a L<Paws::IAM::UpdateRoleDescriptionResponse> instance

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::UpdateServerCertificate>

Returns: nothing

  Updates the name and/or the path of the specified server certificate
stored in IAM.

For more information about working with server certificates, including
a list of AWS services that can use the server certificates that you
manage with IAM, go to Working with Server Certificates in the I<IAM
User Guide>.

You should understand the implications of changing a server
certificate's path or name. For more information, see Renaming a Server
Certificate in the I<IAM User Guide>.

To change a server certificate name the requester must have appropriate
permissions on both the source object and the target object. For
example, to change the name from "ProductionCert" to "ProdCert", the
entity making the request must have permission on "ProductionCert" and
"ProdCert", or must have permission on all (*). For more information
about permissions, see Access Management in the I<IAM User Guide>.


=head2 UpdateServiceSpecificCredential(ServiceSpecificCredentialId => Str, Status => Str, [UserName => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::UpdateServiceSpecificCredential>

Returns: nothing

  Sets the status of a service-specific credential to C<Active> or
C<Inactive>. Service-specific credentials that are inactive cannot be
used for authentication to the service. This action can be used to
disable a userE<rsquo>s service-specific credential as part of a
credential rotation work flow.


=head2 UpdateSigningCertificate(CertificateId => Str, Status => Str, [UserName => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::UpdateSigningCertificate>

Returns: nothing

  Changes the status of the specified user signing certificate from
active to disabled, or vice versa. This action can be used to disable
an IAM user's signing certificate as part of a certificate rotation
work flow.

If the C<UserName> field is not specified, the UserName is determined
implicitly based on the AWS access key ID used to sign the request.
Because this action works for access keys under the AWS account, you
can use this action to manage root credentials even if the AWS account
has no associated users.


=head2 UpdateSSHPublicKey(SSHPublicKeyId => Str, Status => Str, UserName => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::UpdateSSHPublicKey>

Returns: nothing

  Sets the status of an IAM user's SSH public key to active or inactive.
SSH public keys that are inactive cannot be used for authentication.
This action can be used to disable a user's SSH public key as part of a
key rotation work flow.

The SSH public key affected by this action is used only for
authenticating the associated IAM user to an AWS CodeCommit repository.
For more information about using SSH keys to authenticate to an AWS
CodeCommit repository, see Set up AWS CodeCommit for SSH Connections in
the I<AWS CodeCommit User Guide>.


=head2 UpdateUser(UserName => Str, [NewPath => Str, NewUserName => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::UpdateUser>

Returns: nothing

  Updates the name and/or the path of the specified IAM user.

You should understand the implications of changing an IAM user's path
or name. For more information, see Renaming an IAM User and Renaming an
IAM Group in the I<IAM User Guide>.

To change a user name the requester must have appropriate permissions
on both the source object and the target object. For example, to change
Bob to Robert, the entity making the request must have permission on
Bob and Robert, or must have permission on all (*). For more
information about permissions, see Permissions and Policies.


=head2 UploadServerCertificate(CertificateBody => Str, PrivateKey => Str, ServerCertificateName => Str, [CertificateChain => Str, Path => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::UploadServerCertificate>

Returns: a L<Paws::IAM::UploadServerCertificateResponse> instance

  Uploads a server certificate entity for the AWS account. The server
certificate entity includes a public key certificate, a private key,
and an optional certificate chain, which should all be PEM-encoded.

We recommend that you use AWS Certificate Manager to provision, manage,
and deploy your server certificates. With ACM you can request a
certificate, deploy it to AWS resources, and let ACM handle certificate
renewals for you. Certificates provided by ACM are free. For more
information about using ACM, see the AWS Certificate Manager User
Guide.

For more information about working with server certificates, including
a list of AWS services that can use the server certificates that you
manage with IAM, go to Working with Server Certificates in the I<IAM
User Guide>.

For information about the number of server certificates you can upload,
see Limitations on IAM Entities and Objects in the I<IAM User Guide>.

Because the body of the public key certificate, private key, and the
certificate chain can be large, you should use POST rather than GET
when calling C<UploadServerCertificate>. For information about setting
up signatures and authorization through the API, go to Signing AWS API
Requests in the I<AWS General Reference>. For general information about
using the Query API with IAM, go to Calling the API by Making HTTP
Query Requests in the I<IAM User Guide>.


=head2 UploadSigningCertificate(CertificateBody => Str, [UserName => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::UploadSigningCertificate>

Returns: a L<Paws::IAM::UploadSigningCertificateResponse> instance

  Uploads an X.509 signing certificate and associates it with the
specified IAM user. Some AWS services use X.509 signing certificates to
validate requests that are signed with a corresponding private key.
When you upload the certificate, its default status is C<Active>.

If the C<UserName> field is not specified, the IAM user name is
determined implicitly based on the AWS access key ID used to sign the
request. Because this action works for access keys under the AWS
account, you can use this action to manage root credentials even if the
AWS account has no associated users.

Because the body of a X.509 certificate can be large, you should use
POST rather than GET when calling C<UploadSigningCertificate>. For
information about setting up signatures and authorization through the
API, go to Signing AWS API Requests in the I<AWS General Reference>.
For general information about using the Query API with IAM, go to
Making Query Requests in the I<IAM User Guide>.


=head2 UploadSSHPublicKey(SSHPublicKeyBody => Str, UserName => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::IAM::UploadSSHPublicKey>

Returns: a L<Paws::IAM::UploadSSHPublicKeyResponse> instance

  Uploads an SSH public key and associates it with the specified IAM
user.

The SSH public key uploaded by this action can be used only for
authenticating the associated IAM user to an AWS CodeCommit repository.
For more information about using SSH keys to authenticate to an AWS
CodeCommit repository, see Set up AWS CodeCommit for SSH Connections in
the I<AWS CodeCommit User Guide>.
