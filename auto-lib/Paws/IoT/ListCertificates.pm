=head1 NAME

Paws::IoT::ListCertificates - Arguments for method ListCertificates on Paws::IoT

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ListCertificates on the 
AWS IoT service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ListCertificates.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ListCertificates.

As an example:

  $service_obj->ListCertificates(Att1 => $value1, Att2 => $value2, ...);

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

Specifies the order for results. If True, the results are returned in
ascending order, based on the creation date.



=head2 Marker => Str

The marker for the next set of results.



=head2 PageSize => Int

The result page size.
