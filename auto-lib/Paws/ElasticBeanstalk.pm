=head1 METHODS

=head2 AbortEnvironmentUpdate([EnvironmentId => Str, EnvironmentName => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::ElasticBeanstalk::AbortEnvironmentUpdate>

Returns: nothing

  Cancels in-progress environment configuration update or application
version deployment.


=head2 ApplyEnvironmentManagedAction(ActionId => Str, [EnvironmentId => Str, EnvironmentName => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::ElasticBeanstalk::ApplyEnvironmentManagedAction>

Returns: a L<Paws::ElasticBeanstalk::ApplyEnvironmentManagedActionResult> instance

  Applies a scheduled managed action immediately. A managed action can be
applied only if its status is C<Scheduled>. Get the status and action
ID of a managed action with DescribeEnvironmentManagedActions.


=head2 CheckDNSAvailability(CNAMEPrefix => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::ElasticBeanstalk::CheckDNSAvailability>

Returns: a L<Paws::ElasticBeanstalk::CheckDNSAvailabilityResultMessage> instance

  Checks if the specified CNAME is available.


=head2 ComposeEnvironments([ApplicationName => Str, GroupName => Str, VersionLabels => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::ElasticBeanstalk::ComposeEnvironments>

Returns: a L<Paws::ElasticBeanstalk::EnvironmentDescriptionsMessage> instance

  Create or update a group of environments that each run a separate
component of a single application. Takes a list of version labels that
specify application source bundles for each of the environments to
create or update. The name of each environment and other required
information must be included in the source bundles in an environment
manifest named C<env.yaml>. See Compose Environments for details.


=head2 CreateApplication(ApplicationName => Str, [Description => Str, ResourceLifecycleConfig => L<Paws::ElasticBeanstalk::ApplicationResourceLifecycleConfig>])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::ElasticBeanstalk::CreateApplication>

Returns: a L<Paws::ElasticBeanstalk::ApplicationDescriptionMessage> instance

  Creates an application that has one configuration template named
C<default> and no application versions.


=head2 CreateApplicationVersion(ApplicationName => Str, VersionLabel => Str, [AutoCreateApplication => Bool, BuildConfiguration => L<Paws::ElasticBeanstalk::BuildConfiguration>, Description => Str, Process => Bool, SourceBuildInformation => L<Paws::ElasticBeanstalk::SourceBuildInformation>, SourceBundle => L<Paws::ElasticBeanstalk::S3Location>])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::ElasticBeanstalk::CreateApplicationVersion>

Returns: a L<Paws::ElasticBeanstalk::ApplicationVersionDescriptionMessage> instance

create an application version from a source bundle in Amazon S3, a
commit in AWS CodeCommit, or the output of an AWS CodeBuild build as
follows:

Specify a commit in an AWS CodeCommit repository with
C<SourceBuildInformation>.

Specify a build in an AWS CodeBuild with C<SourceBuildInformation> and
C<BuildConfiguration>.

Specify a source bundle in S3 with C<SourceBundle>

Omit both C<SourceBuildInformation> and C<SourceBundle> to use the
default sample application.

Once you create an application version with a specified Amazon S3
bucket and key location, you cannot change that Amazon S3 location. If
you change the Amazon S3 location, you receive an exception when you
attempt to launch an environment from the application version.


=head2 CreateConfigurationTemplate(ApplicationName => Str, TemplateName => Str, [Description => Str, EnvironmentId => Str, OptionSettings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ElasticBeanstalk::ConfigurationOptionSetting>], PlatformArn => Str, SolutionStackName => Str, SourceConfiguration => L<Paws::ElasticBeanstalk::SourceConfiguration>])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::ElasticBeanstalk::CreateConfigurationTemplate>

Returns: a L<Paws::ElasticBeanstalk::ConfigurationSettingsDescription> instance

  Creates a configuration template. Templates are associated with a
specific application and are used to deploy different versions of the
application with the same configuration settings.

and AWS Elastic Beanstalk returns an C<InvalidParameterCombination>
error.

When updating the configuration settings to a new template or
individual settings, a draft configuration is created and
DescribeConfigurationSettings for this environment returns two setting
descriptions with different C<DeploymentStatus> values.

=head1 PAGINATORS

Paginator methods are helpers that repetively call methods that return partial results

=head2 DescribeAllEvents(sub { },[ApplicationName => Str, EndTime => Str, EnvironmentId => Str, EnvironmentName => Str, MaxRecords => Int, NextToken => Str, PlatformArn => Str, RequestId => Str, Severity => Str, StartTime => Str, TemplateName => Str, VersionLabel => Str])

=head2 DescribeAllEvents([ApplicationName => Str, EndTime => Str, EnvironmentId => Str, EnvironmentName => Str, MaxRecords => Int, NextToken => Str, PlatformArn => Str, RequestId => Str, Severity => Str, StartTime => Str, TemplateName => Str, VersionLabel => Str])


If passed a sub as first parameter, it will call the sub for each element found in :

 - Events, passing the object as the first parameter, and the string 'Events' as the second parameter 

If not, it will return a a L<Paws::ElasticBeanstalk::EventDescriptionsMessage> instance with all the C<param>s;  from all the responses. Please take into account that this mode can potentially consume vasts ammounts of memory.
