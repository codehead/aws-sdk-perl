Paws::Pinpoint::CreateCampaign - Arguments for method CreateCampaign on Paws::Pinpoint

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateCampaign on the 
Amazon Pinpoint service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateCampaign.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateCampaign.
