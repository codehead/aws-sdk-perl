=head1 NAME

Paws::KMS - Perl Interface to AWS AWS Key Management Service

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Paws;

  my $obj = Paws->service('KMS');
  my $res = $obj->Method(
    Arg1 => $val1,
    Arg2 => [ 'V1', 'V2' ],
    # if Arg3 is an object, the HashRef will be used as arguments to the constructor
    # of the arguments type
    Arg3 => { Att1 => 'Val1' },
    # if Arg4 is an array of objects, the HashRefs will be passed as arguments to
    # the constructor of the arguments type
    Arg4 => [ { Att1 => 'Val1'  }, { Att1 => 'Val2' } ],
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

AWS Key Management Service

AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is an encryption and key
management web service. This guide describes the AWS KMS operations
that you can call programmatically. For general information about AWS
KMS, see the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various
programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, Android,
etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access
to AWS KMS and other AWS services. For example, the SDKs take care of
tasks such as signing requests (see below), managing errors, and
retrying requests automatically. For more information about the AWS
SDKs, including how to download and install them, see Tools for Amazon
Web Services.

We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls
to AWS KMS.

Clients must support TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.0. We recommend
TLS 1.2. Clients must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward
Secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve
Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7
and later support these modes.

B<Signing Requests>

Requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access
key. We strongly recommend that you I<do not> use your AWS account
(root) access key ID and secret key for everyday work with AWS KMS.
Instead, use the access key ID and secret access key for an IAM user,
or you can use the AWS Security Token Service to generate temporary
security credentials that you can use to sign requests.

All AWS KMS operations require Signature Version 4.

B<Logging API Requests>

AWS KMS supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that logs AWS API calls and
related events for your AWS account and delivers them to an Amazon S3
bucket that you specify. By using the information collected by
CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to AWS KMS, who
made the request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about
CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see
the AWS CloudTrail User Guide.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 CancelKeyDeletion(KeyId => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KMS::CancelKeyDeletion>

Returns: a L<Paws::KMS::CancelKeyDeletionResponse> instance

  Cancels the deletion of a customer master key (CMK). When this
operation is successful, the CMK is set to the C<Disabled> state. To
enable a CMK, use EnableKey.

For more information about scheduling and canceling deletion of a CMK,
see Deleting Customer Master Keys in the I<AWS Key Management Service
Developer Guide>.


=head2 CreateAlias(AliasName => Str, TargetKeyId => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KMS::CreateAlias>

Returns: nothing

  Creates a display name for a customer master key. An alias can be used
to identify a key and should be unique. The console enforces a
one-to-one mapping between the alias and a key. An alias name can
contain only alphanumeric characters, forward slashes (/), underscores
(_), and dashes (-). An alias must start with the word "alias" followed
by a forward slash (alias/). An alias that begins with "aws" after the
forward slash (alias/aws...) is reserved by Amazon Web Services (AWS).

The alias and the key it is mapped to must be in the same AWS account
and the same region.

To map an alias to a different key, call UpdateAlias.


=head2 CreateGrant(GranteePrincipal => Str, KeyId => Str, [Constraints => L<Paws::KMS::GrantConstraints>, GrantTokens => ArrayRef[Str|Undef], Name => Str, Operations => ArrayRef[Str|Undef], RetiringPrincipal => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KMS::CreateGrant>

Returns: a L<Paws::KMS::CreateGrantResponse> instance

  Adds a grant to a key to specify who can use the key and under what
conditions. Grants are alternate permission mechanisms to key policies.

For more information about grants, see Grants in the I<AWS Key
Management Service Developer Guide>.


=head2 CreateKey([BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck => Bool, Description => Str, KeyUsage => Str, Origin => Str, Policy => Str, Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::KMS::Tag>]])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KMS::CreateKey>

Returns: a L<Paws::KMS::CreateKeyResponse> instance

  Creates a customer master key (CMK).

You can use a CMK to encrypt small amounts of data (4 KiB or less)
directly, but CMKs are more commonly used to encrypt data encryption
keys (DEKs), which are used to encrypt raw data. For more information
about DEKs and the difference between CMKs and DEKs, see the following:

=head2 Decrypt(CiphertextBlob => Str, [EncryptionContext => L<Paws::KMS::EncryptionContextType>, GrantTokens => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KMS::Decrypt>

Returns: a L<Paws::KMS::DecryptResponse> instance

  Decrypts ciphertext. Ciphertext is plaintext that has been previously
encrypted by using any of the following functions:

=over

=item *

GenerateDataKey

=item *

GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext

=item *

Encrypt

=back

Note that if a caller has been granted access permissions to all keys
(through, for example, IAM user policies that grant C<Decrypt>
permission on all resources), then ciphertext encrypted by using keys
in other accounts where the key grants access to the caller can be
decrypted. To remedy this, we recommend that you do not grant
C<Decrypt> access in an IAM user policy. Instead grant C<Decrypt>
access only in key policies. If you must grant C<Decrypt> access in an
IAM user policy, you should scope the resource to specific keys or to
specific trusted accounts.


=head2 DeleteAlias(AliasName => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KMS::DeleteAlias>

Returns: nothing

  Deletes the specified alias. To map an alias to a different key, call
UpdateAlias.


=head2 DeleteImportedKeyMaterial(KeyId => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KMS::DeleteImportedKeyMaterial>

Returns: nothing

  Deletes key material that you previously imported and makes the
specified customer master key (CMK) unusable. For more information
about importing key material into AWS KMS, see Importing Key Material
in the I<AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide>.

When the specified CMK is in the C<PendingDeletion> state, this
operation does not change the CMK's state. Otherwise, it changes the
CMK's state to C<PendingImport>.

After you delete key material, you can use ImportKeyMaterial to
reimport the same key material into the CMK.


=head2 DescribeKey(KeyId => Str, [GrantTokens => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KMS::DescribeKey>

Returns: a L<Paws::KMS::DescribeKeyResponse> instance

  Provides detailed information about the specified customer master key.


=head2 DisableKey(KeyId => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KMS::DisableKey>

Returns: nothing

  Sets the state of a customer master key (CMK) to disabled, thereby
preventing its use for cryptographic operations. For more information
about how key state affects the use of a CMK, see How Key State Affects
the Use of a Customer Master Key in the I<AWS Key Management Service
Developer Guide>.


=head2 DisableKeyRotation(KeyId => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KMS::DisableKeyRotation>

Returns: nothing

  Disables rotation of the specified key.


=head2 EnableKey(KeyId => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KMS::EnableKey>

Returns: nothing

  Marks a key as enabled, thereby permitting its use.


=head2 EnableKeyRotation(KeyId => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KMS::EnableKeyRotation>

Returns: nothing

  Enables rotation of the specified customer master key.


=head2 Encrypt(KeyId => Str, Plaintext => Str, [EncryptionContext => L<Paws::KMS::EncryptionContextType>, GrantTokens => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KMS::Encrypt>

Returns: a L<Paws::KMS::EncryptResponse> instance

  Encrypts plaintext into ciphertext by using a customer master key. The
C<Encrypt> function has two primary use cases:

=over

=item *

You can encrypt up to 4 KB of arbitrary data such as an RSA key, a
database password, or other sensitive customer information.

=item *

If you are moving encrypted data from one region to another, you can
use this API to encrypt in the new region the plaintext data key that
was used to encrypt the data in the original region. This provides you
with an encrypted copy of the data key that can be decrypted in the new
region and used there to decrypt the encrypted data.

=back

Unless you are moving encrypted data from one region to another, you
don't use this function to encrypt a generated data key within a
region. You retrieve data keys already encrypted by calling the
GenerateDataKey or GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext function. Data keys
don't need to be encrypted again by calling C<Encrypt>.

If you want to encrypt data locally in your application, you can use
the C<GenerateDataKey> function to return a plaintext data encryption
key and a copy of the key encrypted under the customer master key (CMK)
of your choosing.


=head2 GenerateDataKey(KeyId => Str, [EncryptionContext => L<Paws::KMS::EncryptionContextType>, GrantTokens => ArrayRef[Str|Undef], KeySpec => Str, NumberOfBytes => Int])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KMS::GenerateDataKey>

Returns: a L<Paws::KMS::GenerateDataKeyResponse> instance

  Returns a data encryption key that you can use in your application to
encrypt data locally.

You must specify the customer master key (CMK) under which to generate
the data key. You must also specify the length of the data key using
either the C<KeySpec> or C<NumberOfBytes> field. You must specify one
field or the other, but not both. For common key lengths (128-bit and
256-bit symmetric keys), we recommend that you use C<KeySpec>.

This operation returns a plaintext copy of the data key in the
C<Plaintext> field of the response, and an encrypted copy of the data
key in the C<CiphertextBlob> field. The data key is encrypted under the
CMK specified in the C<KeyId> field of the request.

We recommend that you use the following pattern to encrypt data locally
in your application:

=over

=item 1.

Use this operation (C<GenerateDataKey>) to retrieve a data encryption
key.

=item 2.

Use the plaintext data encryption key (returned in the C<Plaintext>
field of the response) to encrypt data locally, then erase the
plaintext data key from memory.

=item 3.

Store the encrypted data key (returned in the C<CiphertextBlob> field
of the response) alongside the locally encrypted data.

=back

To decrypt data locally:

=over

=item 1.

Use the Decrypt operation to decrypt the encrypted data key into a
plaintext copy of the data key.

=item 2.

Use the plaintext data key to decrypt data locally, then erase the
plaintext data key from memory.

=back

To return only an encrypted copy of the data key, use
GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext. To return a random byte string that is
cryptographically secure, use GenerateRandom.

If you use the optional C<EncryptionContext> field, you must store at
least enough information to be able to reconstruct the full encryption
context when you later send the ciphertext to the Decrypt operation. It
is a good practice to choose an encryption context that you can
reconstruct on the fly to better secure the ciphertext. For more
information, see Encryption Context in the I<AWS Key Management Service
Developer Guide>.


=head2 GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext(KeyId => Str, [EncryptionContext => L<Paws::KMS::EncryptionContextType>, GrantTokens => ArrayRef[Str|Undef], KeySpec => Str, NumberOfBytes => Int])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KMS::GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext>

Returns: a L<Paws::KMS::GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintextResponse> instance

  Returns a data encryption key encrypted under a customer master key
(CMK). This operation is identical to GenerateDataKey but returns only
the encrypted copy of the data key.

This operation is useful in a system that has multiple components with
different degrees of trust. For example, consider a system that stores
encrypted data in containers. Each container stores the encrypted data
and an encrypted copy of the data key. One component of the system,
called the I<control plane>, creates new containers. When it creates a
new container, it uses this operation
(C<GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext>) to get an encrypted data key and
then stores it in the container. Later, a different component of the
system, called the I<data plane>, puts encrypted data into the
containers. To do this, it passes the encrypted data key to the Decrypt
operation, then uses the returned plaintext data key to encrypt data,
and finally stores the encrypted data in the container. In this system,
the control plane never sees the plaintext data key.


=head2 GenerateRandom([NumberOfBytes => Int])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KMS::GenerateRandom>

Returns: a L<Paws::KMS::GenerateRandomResponse> instance

  Returns a random byte string that is cryptographically secure.

For more information about entropy and random number generation, see
the AWS Key Management Service Cryptographic Details whitepaper.


=head2 GetKeyPolicy(KeyId => Str, PolicyName => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KMS::GetKeyPolicy>

Returns: a L<Paws::KMS::GetKeyPolicyResponse> instance

  Retrieves a policy attached to the specified key.


=head2 GetKeyRotationStatus(KeyId => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KMS::GetKeyRotationStatus>

Returns: a L<Paws::KMS::GetKeyRotationStatusResponse> instance

  Retrieves a Boolean value that indicates whether key rotation is
enabled for the specified key.


=head2 GetParametersForImport(KeyId => Str, WrappingAlgorithm => Str, WrappingKeySpec => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KMS::GetParametersForImport>

Returns: a L<Paws::KMS::GetParametersForImportResponse> instance

  Returns the items you need in order to import key material into AWS KMS
from your existing key management infrastructure. For more information
about importing key material into AWS KMS, see Importing Key Material
in the I<AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide>.

You must specify the key ID of the customer master key (CMK) into which
you will import key material. This CMK's C<Origin> must be C<EXTERNAL>.
You must also specify the wrapping algorithm and type of wrapping key
(public key) that you will use to encrypt the key material.

This operation returns a public key and an import token. Use the public
key to encrypt the key material. Store the import token to send with a
subsequent ImportKeyMaterial request. The public key and import token
from the same response must be used together. These items are valid for
24 hours, after which they cannot be used for a subsequent
ImportKeyMaterial request. To retrieve new ones, send another
C<GetParametersForImport> request.


=head2 ImportKeyMaterial(EncryptedKeyMaterial => Str, ImportToken => Str, KeyId => Str, [ExpirationModel => Str, ValidTo => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KMS::ImportKeyMaterial>

Returns: a L<Paws::KMS::ImportKeyMaterialResponse> instance

  Imports key material into an AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) from
your existing key management infrastructure. For more information about
importing key material into AWS KMS, see Importing Key Material in the
I<AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide>.

You must specify the key ID of the CMK to import the key material into.
This CMK's C<Origin> must be C<EXTERNAL>. You must also send an import
token and the encrypted key material. Send the import token that you
received in the same GetParametersForImport response that contained the
public key that you used to encrypt the key material. You must also
specify whether the key material expires and if so, when. When the key
material expires, AWS KMS deletes the key material and the CMK becomes
unusable. To use the CMK again, you can reimport the same key material.
If you set an expiration date, you can change it only by reimporting
the same key material and specifying a new expiration date.

When this operation is successful, the specified CMK's key state
changes to C<Enabled>, and you can use the CMK.

After you successfully import key material into a CMK, you can reimport
the same key material into that CMK, but you cannot import different
key material.


=head2 ListAliases([Limit => Int, Marker => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KMS::ListAliases>

Returns: a L<Paws::KMS::ListAliasesResponse> instance

  Lists all of the key aliases in the account.


=head2 ListGrants(KeyId => Str, [Limit => Int, Marker => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KMS::ListGrants>

Returns: a L<Paws::KMS::ListGrantsResponse> instance

  List the grants for a specified key.


=head2 ListKeyPolicies(KeyId => Str, [Limit => Int, Marker => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KMS::ListKeyPolicies>

Returns: a L<Paws::KMS::ListKeyPoliciesResponse> instance

  Retrieves a list of policies attached to a key.


=head2 ListKeys([Limit => Int, Marker => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KMS::ListKeys>

Returns: a L<Paws::KMS::ListKeysResponse> instance

  Lists the customer master keys.


=head2 ListResourceTags(KeyId => Str, [Limit => Int, Marker => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KMS::ListResourceTags>

Returns: a L<Paws::KMS::ListResourceTagsResponse> instance

  Returns a list of all tags for the specified customer master key (CMK).


=head2 ListRetirableGrants(RetiringPrincipal => Str, [Limit => Int, Marker => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KMS::ListRetirableGrants>

Returns: a L<Paws::KMS::ListGrantsResponse> instance

  Returns a list of all grants for which the grant's C<RetiringPrincipal>
matches the one specified.

A typical use is to list all grants that you are able to retire. To
retire a grant, use RetireGrant.


=head2 PutKeyPolicy(KeyId => Str, Policy => Str, PolicyName => Str, [BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck => Bool])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KMS::PutKeyPolicy>

Returns: nothing

  Attaches a key policy to the specified customer master key (CMK).

For more information about key policies, see Key Policies in the I<AWS
Key Management Service Developer Guide>.


=head2 ReEncrypt(CiphertextBlob => Str, DestinationKeyId => Str, [DestinationEncryptionContext => L<Paws::KMS::EncryptionContextType>, GrantTokens => ArrayRef[Str|Undef], SourceEncryptionContext => L<Paws::KMS::EncryptionContextType>])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KMS::ReEncrypt>

Returns: a L<Paws::KMS::ReEncryptResponse> instance

  Encrypts data on the server side with a new customer master key (CMK)
without exposing the plaintext of the data on the client side. The data
is first decrypted and then reencrypted. You can also use this
operation to change the encryption context of a ciphertext.

Unlike other operations, C<ReEncrypt> is authorized twice, once as
C<ReEncryptFrom> on the source CMK and once as C<ReEncryptTo> on the
destination CMK. We recommend that you include the C<"kms:ReEncrypt*">
permission in your key policies to permit reencryption from or to the
CMK. This permission is automatically included in the key policy when
you create a CMK through the console, but you must include it manually
when you create a CMK programmatically or when you set a key policy
with the PutKeyPolicy operation.


=head2 RetireGrant([GrantId => Str, GrantToken => Str, KeyId => Str])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KMS::RetireGrant>

Returns: nothing

  Retires a grant. To clean up, you can retire a grant when you're done
using it. You should revoke a grant when you intend to actively deny
operations that depend on it. The following are permitted to call this
API:

=over

=item *

The AWS account (root user) under which the grant was created

=item *

The C<RetiringPrincipal>, if present in the grant

=item *

The C<GranteePrincipal>, if C<RetireGrant> is an operation specified in
the grant

=back

You must identify the grant to retire by its grant token or by a
combination of the grant ID and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the
customer master key (CMK). A grant token is a unique variable-length
base64-encoded string. A grant ID is a 64 character unique identifier
of a grant. The CreateGrant operation returns both.


=head2 RevokeGrant(GrantId => Str, KeyId => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KMS::RevokeGrant>

Returns: nothing

  Revokes a grant. You can revoke a grant to actively deny operations
that depend on it.


=head2 ScheduleKeyDeletion(KeyId => Str, [PendingWindowInDays => Int])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KMS::ScheduleKeyDeletion>

Returns: a L<Paws::KMS::ScheduleKeyDeletionResponse> instance

  Schedules the deletion of a customer master key (CMK). You may provide
a waiting period, specified in days, before deletion occurs. If you do
not provide a waiting period, the default period of 30 days is used.
When this operation is successful, the state of the CMK changes to
C<PendingDeletion>. Before the waiting period ends, you can use
CancelKeyDeletion to cancel the deletion of the CMK. After the waiting
period ends, AWS KMS deletes the CMK and all AWS KMS data associated
with it, including all aliases that refer to it.

Deleting a CMK is a destructive and potentially dangerous operation.
When a CMK is deleted, all data that was encrypted under the CMK is
rendered unrecoverable. To restrict the use of a CMK without deleting
it, use DisableKey.

For more information about scheduling a CMK for deletion, see Deleting
Customer Master Keys in the I<AWS Key Management Service Developer
Guide>.


=head2 TagResource(KeyId => Str, Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::KMS::Tag>])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KMS::TagResource>

Returns: nothing

  Adds or overwrites one or more tags for the specified customer master
key (CMK).

Each tag consists of a tag key and a tag value. Tag keys and tag values
are both required, but tag values can be empty (null) strings.

You cannot use the same tag key more than once per CMK. For example,
consider a CMK with one tag whose tag key is C<Purpose> and tag value
is C<Test>. If you send a C<TagResource> request for this CMK with a
tag key of C<Purpose> and a tag value of C<Prod>, it does not create a
second tag. Instead, the original tag is overwritten with the new tag
value.


=head2 UntagResource(KeyId => Str, TagKeys => ArrayRef[Str|Undef])

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KMS::UntagResource>

Returns: nothing

  Removes the specified tag or tags from the specified customer master
key (CMK).

To remove a tag, you specify the tag key for each tag to remove. You do
not specify the tag value. To overwrite the tag value for an existing
tag, use TagResource.


=head2 UpdateAlias(AliasName => Str, TargetKeyId => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KMS::UpdateAlias>

Returns: nothing

  Updates an alias to map it to a different key.

An alias is not a property of a key. Therefore, an alias can be mapped
to and unmapped from an existing key without changing the properties of
the key.

An alias name can contain only alphanumeric characters, forward slashes
(/), underscores (_), and dashes (-). An alias must start with the word
"alias" followed by a forward slash (alias/). An alias that begins with
"aws" after the forward slash (alias/aws...) is reserved by Amazon Web
Services (AWS).

The alias and the key it is mapped to must be in the same AWS account
and the same region.


=head2 UpdateKeyDescription(Description => Str, KeyId => Str)

Each argument is described in detail in: L<Paws::KMS::UpdateKeyDescription>

Returns: nothing

  Updates the description of a customer master key (CMK).
