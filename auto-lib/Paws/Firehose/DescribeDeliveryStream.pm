=head1 NAME

Paws::Firehose::DescribeDeliveryStream - Arguments for method DescribeDeliveryStream on Paws::Firehose

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DescribeDeliveryStream on the 
Amazon Kinesis Firehose service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DescribeDeliveryStream.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DescribeDeliveryStream.

As an example:

  $service_obj->DescribeDeliveryStream(Att1 => $value1, Att2 => $value2, ...);

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
