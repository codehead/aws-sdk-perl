=head1 NAME

Paws::EC2::DescribeReservedInstancesOfferings - Arguments for method DescribeReservedInstancesOfferings on Paws::EC2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DescribeReservedInstancesOfferings on the 
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DescribeReservedInstancesOfferings.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DescribeReservedInstancesOfferings.

As an example:

  $service_obj->DescribeReservedInstancesOfferings(Att1 => $value1, Att2 => $value2, ...);

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 DryRun => Bool

Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action,
without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If

One or more filters.

=over

=item *

C<availability-zone> - The Availability Zone where the Reserved
Instance can be used.
